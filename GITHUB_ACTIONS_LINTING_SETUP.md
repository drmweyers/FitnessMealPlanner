# 🤖 GitHub Actions Automated Linting - Setup Complete

**Status:** ✅ Active and Running
**Configured:** October 19, 2025

## ✨ What Was Set Up

### 1. **Automatic Lint Checks** (`lint.yml`)
Every time you push code or create a pull request to `main`, `qa-ready`, or `qa-ready-clean`:

✅ **Runs automatically** - No manual intervention needed
✅ **Checks client code** - Production frontend must be error-free
✅ **Checks server code** - Warnings only, doesn't block
✅ **Comments on PRs** - Beautiful table showing results
✅ **Blocks bad code** - Can't merge if client has errors

### 2. **Auto-Fix Workflow** (`lint-autofix.yml`)
Automatically fixes simple linting issues on feature branches:

✅ **Auto-runs on:** `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `hotfix/*` branches
✅ **Can trigger manually** - From GitHub Actions tab
✅ **Commits fixes** - Pushes back to your branch
✅ **Smart skipping** - Add `[skip-lint]` to skip

## 📍 Where to See It

1. **GitHub Actions Tab:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/drmweyers/FitnessMealPlanner/actions
   - You'll see "Lint Code" workflow running

2. **Pull Requests:**
   - When you create a PR, you'll get an automatic comment with lint results
   - Status checks will show ✅ or ❌

3. **Commit Status:**
   - Click on any commit
   - Scroll down to see "Checks" section
   - Click "Details" to see full lint report

## 🎯 Current Status

**Production Frontend (Client):**
- ✅ **0 errors** - Completely error-free!
- 384 warnings - Style suggestions only

**Server:**
- 84 errors - Informational only
- 904 warnings - Can fix gradually

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Normal Development

Just work as usual! Linting happens automatically:

```bash
# 1. Make your changes
# 2. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# 3. Push - linting runs automatically
git push origin main
```

### For Pull Requests

When you create a PR, you'll see:

```markdown
## ✅ Lint Report

### 📊 Results Summary

| Category | Errors | Warnings | Status |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Client (Production)** | 0 | 384 | ✅ PASS |
| **Server** | 84 | 904 | ⚠️ Review |

✨ **Great work!** Client code is error-free and ready for production.
```

### To Skip Auto-Fix

Add `[skip-lint]` to your commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "WIP: experimental feature [skip-lint]"
```

### To Manually Trigger Auto-Fix

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click "Auto-fix Lint Issues"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select your branch
5. Click green "Run workflow" button

## 🛠️ Local Development

Run linting before pushing:

```bash
# Check everything
npm run lint

# Check only production code
npm run lint:client

# Auto-fix what you can
npm run lint:fix
```

## 📋 What Gets Checked

### ✅ Blocks Merge (Must Fix)
- **Client code errors** - Production frontend must be perfect
- Missing React imports
- Syntax errors
- Type errors

### ⚠️ Warns (Should Fix Eventually)
- Server code errors
- Test file errors
- TypeScript `any` types
- Unused variables
- React Hook dependencies

## 🎨 Status Badge (Optional)

Add this to your README.md to show lint status:

```markdown
[![Lint Status](https://github.com/drmweyers/FitnessMealPlanner/workflows/Lint%20Code/badge.svg)](https://github.com/drmweyers/FitnessMealPlanner/actions/workflows/lint.yml)
```

## 🔧 Configuration Files

All configuration is in these files:

- **`.github/workflows/lint.yml`** - Main lint workflow
- **`.github/workflows/lint-autofix.yml`** - Auto-fix workflow
- **`eslint.config.js`** - ESLint rules and settings
- **`package.json`** - npm scripts for linting

## ⚙️ Customization

### Change Which Branches Get Checked

Edit `.github/workflows/lint.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, qa-ready, develop ]  # Add/remove branches
```

### Change Auto-Fix Branches

Edit `.github/workflows/lint-autofix.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'feature/**'
      - 'develop'        # Add more patterns
```

### Make Server Errors Block Too

In `.github/workflows/lint.yml`, change:

```yaml
- name: Run ESLint on server
  run: npm run lint:server
  continue-on-error: false  # Change true to false
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow not running?
- Check you pushed to the right branch (main, qa-ready, qa-ready-clean)
- Look at Actions tab for any errors

### Auto-fix not committing?
- Make sure branch is `feature/*`, `fix/*`, or `hotfix/*`
- Check workflow has write permissions

### PR comment not appearing?
- Wait a few seconds, it takes time
- Check the Actions tab to see if workflow completed

## 📚 Documentation

Full documentation in:
- `.github/workflows/README.md` - Detailed workflow documentation
