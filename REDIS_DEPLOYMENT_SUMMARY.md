## üéØ Production-Ready Architecture

### Redis Configuration for FitnessMealPlanner

```yaml
# Optimized for your application workload
Memory Limit: 256MB (expandable)
Eviction Policy: allkeys-lru (optimal for cache workload)
Persistence: RDB + AOF (balanced durability/performance)
High Availability: Redis Sentinel (2 instances)
Security: TLS + ACL + Network isolation
Monitoring: Comprehensive metrics and alerting
```

### Application Integration Points

**Cache Databases:**
- Database 0: General application cache
- Database 1: User sessions
- Database 2: Meal plan cache
- Database 3-15: Available for expansion

**Cache Key Patterns:**
```
recipe:{id}                 # Recipe details
user:{userId}:session       # User session data
mealplan:{userId}:{date}    # Daily meal plans
search:{hash}               # Search result cache
nutrition:{ingredient}      # Nutrition data
preferences:{userId}        # User preferences
```
