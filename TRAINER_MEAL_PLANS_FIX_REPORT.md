## 🐛 Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Found
**File:** `/server/middleware/analyticsMiddleware.ts`  
**Line:** 400  
**Error:** `ReferenceError: SUSPICIOUS_IPS is not defined`

### Technical Details
The analytics middleware was attempting to access `SUSPICIOUS_IPS` directly:
```javascript
// INCORRECT CODE (Line 400)
if (SUSPICIOUS_IPS.has(ip)) riskScore += 50;
```

However, `SUSPICIOUS_IPS` was defined as a property of the `SUSPICIOUS_PATTERNS` object:
```javascript
// Line 41
const SUSPICIOUS_PATTERNS = {
  // ... other properties
  SUSPICIOUS_IPS: new Set<string>()
};
```

### Impact
- The middleware error prevented ALL API routes from functioning
- The `/api/trainer/meal-plans` endpoint could not return data
- The React frontend loaded but received no data, resulting in a blank page

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Fix Implementation
**Changed Line 400 to:**
```javascript
if (SUSPICIOUS_PATTERNS.SUSPICIOUS_IPS.has(ip)) riskScore += 50;
```

### Files Modified
- `/server/middleware/analyticsMiddleware.ts` (Line 400)
