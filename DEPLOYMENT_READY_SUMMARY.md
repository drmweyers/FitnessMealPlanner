## üö¶ Deployment Process (New)

### Before Every Deployment

```bash
# 1. Run verification script
bash scripts/verify-deployment.sh

# 2. Run full deployment test (optional but recommended)
bash scripts/test-deployment.sh

# 3. Review checklist
# See DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
```

### For Dev Server Deployment

```bash
# 1. Verify environment variables set on dev server
# 2. Build and push Docker image
docker build --target prod -t your-registry/fitmeal:dev .
docker push your-registry/fitmeal:dev

# 3. Deploy to dev server
# (Platform-specific: Digital Ocean, AWS, etc.)

# 4. Monitor logs for 15 minutes
# Check for errors and verify functionality
```

### For Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è  ONLY deploy after successful dev deployment
# 2. Create database backup
# 3. Tag release in git
git tag -a v1.x.x -m "Release v1.x.x"

# 4. Build and push production image
docker build --target prod -t your-registry/fitmeal:prod .
docker push your-registry/fitmeal:prod

# 5. Deploy to production
# (Platform-specific)

# 6. Monitor logs for 30 minutes
# 7. Run smoke tests (see checklist)
```

## üîë Critical Environment Variables

Required for deployment (must be set on deployment platform):

```bash
DATABASE_URL              # PostgreSQL connection string
OPENAI_API_KEY           # For meal plan generation
SESSION_SECRET           # Session encryption (32+ chars)
JWT_SECRET               # JWT signing (32+ chars)
S3_BUCKET_NAME          # For image uploads
AWS_REGION              # S3 region
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID       # S3 credentials
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   # S3 credentials

PORT=5001               # Application port
```

Optional but recommended:

```bash
DATABASE_CA_CERT        # For SSL certificate

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to **dev** or **production**:

- [ ] Run `bash scripts/verify-deployment.sh` - all checks pass
- [ ] Run `npm test` - all tests pass
- [ ] Run `npm run check` - no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run `npm run build` - build succeeds
- [ ] Verify `dist/index.js` exists
- [ ] Verify `client/dist/index.html` exists
- [ ] Verify `drizzle.config.ts` exists
- [ ] All environment variables set on deployment platform
- [ ] Database backup created (production only)
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed to git
- [ ] On correct branch (main for production)

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

- ‚úÖ Health endpoint returns 200: `curl https://domain.com/health`
- ‚úÖ Can login with test account
- ‚úÖ Can generate a meal plan
- ‚úÖ Can view and edit grocery lists
- ‚úÖ PDF export works
- ‚úÖ Images load correctly
- ‚úÖ No console errors in browser
- ‚úÖ No errors in server logs
- ‚úÖ Database migrations applied successfully

---

## üÜò If Deployment Fails

### Immediate Steps

1. **Check logs first:**
   ```bash
   # Docker Compose
   docker-compose logs -f

   # Digital Ocean
   doctl apps logs <app-id> --follow

   # Direct Docker
   docker logs <container-id>
   ```

2. **Identify the error** in logs

3. **Consult troubleshooting guide:**
   - See `DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
   - Find your error message
   - Apply the fix

4. **If issue not documented:**
   - Check container file system:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it <container> sh
     ls -la drizzle.config.ts
     ls -la dist/
     ls -la client/dist/
     ```

5. **Rollback if necessary:**
   ```bash
   # Digital Ocean
   doctl apps deployment rollback <app-id> <prev-deployment-id>

   # Docker Compose
   docker-compose down
   git checkout <previous-tag>
   docker-compose --profile prod up
   ```

### Common Quick Fixes

**"drizzle.config.ts not found"**
```bash
# Verify file exists locally
ls -la drizzle.config.ts

# Check Dockerfile copies it
grep "drizzle.config.ts" Dockerfile

# Rebuild with verification
docker build --target prod -t fitmeal:latest . --progress=plain
```

**"React app 404"**
```bash
# Verify client build
ls -la client/dist/index.html

# Check it's copied in Dockerfile
grep "client/dist" Dockerfile

# Rebuild
npm run build
docker build --target prod -t fitmeal:latest .
```

**"Database connection failed"**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Test connection
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT 1;"

# Check SSL config in drizzle.config.ts
```

3. **Then deploy to production**
   - Only after dev is stable
   - During low-traffic period
   - Have rollback plan ready

### Ongoing

1. **Automate verification**
   - Add pre-commit hook: `bash scripts/verify-deployment.sh`
   - Add to CI/CD pipeline: `bash scripts/test-deployment.sh`

2. **Monitor deployments**
   - Set up alerts for errors
   - Track deployment metrics
   - Document new issues in troubleshooting guide

3. **Improve deployment process**
   - Consider blue-green deployments
   - Implement automated rollback
   - Add health check retries
