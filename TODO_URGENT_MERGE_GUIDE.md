# TODO_URGENT.md Merge Guide
**Resolving the Single Documentation Conflict**

---

## The Conflict

**File:** `TODO_URGENT.md`
**Issue:** Modified in both HEAD (commit 63a9e55) and local changes
**Resolution Time:** 2 minutes

---

## What's Different?

### HEAD Content (63a9e55)
```markdown
## üéØ SESSION COMPLETION SUMMARY - September 24, 2025

### Major Achievements:
1. **JWT Refresh Token System**: Fully implemented with automatic refresh middleware
2. **Integration Test Recovery**: Improved from 10% to 60% pass rate (600% improvement)
3. **Test Infrastructure Enhancement**: Overall health improved from 50% to 65%
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified ViteExpress MIME type issue for GUI tests
5. **BMAD Documentation**: Updated all workflow files with Phase 20 progress

### Remaining Issues for Next Session:
1. **GUI Tests**: ViteExpress not serving JS modules with correct MIME type
   - Workaround added but core issue remains
   - Consider switching from ViteExpress or upgrading configuration
2. **Integration Edge Cases**: 4 tests failing on token expiration edge cases
   - Manual expired token creation may not trigger proper flow
3. **Unit Test Coverage**: Still at ~61%, needs improvement

### Technical Debt Resolved:
- ‚úÖ Admin API response headers issue
- ‚úÖ JWT error code alignment
- ‚úÖ Docker X11/Xvfb configuration
- ‚úÖ Stryker mutation testing setup
- ‚úÖ JWT refresh token implementation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT FORGET
The test suite is now functional but not complete. ViteExpress GUI test issues remain the primary blocker.
```

### Local Changes (Your Work)
```markdown
## ü§ñ CONTINUOUS TESTING FRAMEWORK - IMPLEMENTED (January 2025)

**Status:** ‚úÖ FRAMEWORK COMPLETE | ‚ö†Ô∏è 5 TEST FAILURES TO FIX

A Claude-powered autonomous continuous testing framework specifically for Meal Plan Generator that runs without external API calls.

### Deliverables
**‚úÖ Continuous Testing Agent** (482 lines):
- [x] Autonomous test execution every 5 minutes
- [x] Multi-category testing (unit, integration)
- [x] Intelligent failure detection and reporting
- [x] JSON report generation
- [x] Real-time console feedback
- [x] Graceful shutdown handling

**‚úÖ Documentation Suite**:
- [x] `test/continuous-testing/continuous-test-agent.ts` - Main agent
- [x] `test/continuous-testing/verify-setup.ts` - Setup verification
- [x] `test/continuous-testing/CLAUDE_SUBAGENT_SPEC.md` - Technical spec (850 lines)
- [x] `test/continuous-testing/README.md` - User guide
- [x] `test/continuous-testing/QUICK_START.md` - 5-minute quick start
- [x] `BMAD_CONTINUOUS_TESTING_SESSION.md` - Complete session log

**‚úÖ NPM Scripts** (7 new commands):
```bash
npm run test:continuous              # Start continuous testing
npm run test:continuous:auto-fix     # With auto-fix (needs integration work)
npm run test:continuous:unit         # Unit tests only
npm run test:continuous:integration  # Integration tests only
npm run test:continuous:verify       # Verify setup
```

### Current Test Baseline
**Total Tests: 17**
- ‚úÖ Passed: 11 (64.7%)
- ‚ùå Failed: 5 (29.4%)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped: 1 (5.9%)

**Test Cycle Time:** 30-45 seconds (was 5-6 minutes with E2E)

[... 200+ more lines of continuous testing documentation ...]
```

## Merge Strategy

### Option 1: Keep Both Sections (RECOMMENDED ‚≠ê)

Both sections document important work from different time periods:
- HEAD: September 2025 test fixes session
- Local: January 2025 continuous testing framework

**Merged Structure:**
```markdown
# TODO URGENT - Critical Development Priorities
**Created:** 2025-09-24
**Updated:** 2025-01-13
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Top Priority Items

---

## ü§ñ CONTINUOUS TESTING FRAMEWORK - IMPLEMENTED (January 2025)
[... your entire continuous testing section ...]

---

## üéØ SEPTEMBER 2025 SESSION - TEST SUITE STABILIZATION
[... HEAD's September session content ...]

---

## ‚è∞ Timeline
**Total Effort:** ~10 hours
**Target Completion:** End of day
**Next Session:** Continue with continuous testing framework enhancements
```

**Steps:**
1. Open `TODO_URGENT.md` in your editor
2. Keep your continuous testing section at the top (most recent)
3. Add a separator (`---`)
4. Add the September 2025 section below
5. Update the timeline section
6. Save file

---

### Option 2: Separate Historical Section

**Merged Structure:**
```markdown
# TODO URGENT - Critical Development Priorities
**Created:** 2025-09-24
**Updated:** 2025-01-13

---

## üöÄ CURRENT PRIORITIES (January 2025)

### ü§ñ CONTINUOUS TESTING FRAMEWORK - IMPLEMENTED
[... your continuous testing section ...]

---

## üìö HISTORICAL SESSIONS

### September 2025: Test Suite Stabilization
[... HEAD's September content ...]
```

**Steps:**
1. Create "CURRENT PRIORITIES" section
2. Move your continuous testing content there
3. Create "HISTORICAL SESSIONS" section
4. Move September content there
5. Save file

---

## Quick Merge Script

If you want to automate the merge:

```bash
# Save HEAD version
git show HEAD:TODO_URGENT.md > TODO_URGENT_HEAD.md

# Your version is already in working directory
cp TODO_URGENT.md TODO_URGENT_LOCAL.md

# Now manually merge in editor, or use this:
cat > TODO_URGENT.md << 'EOF'
# TODO URGENT - Critical Development Priorities
**Created:** 2025-09-24
**Updated:** 2025-01-13
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Top Priority Items

---

[Paste your continuous testing section here from TODO_URGENT_LOCAL.md]

---

## üìö HISTORICAL SESSIONS

### September 2025: Test Suite Stabilization
[Paste September content here from TODO_URGENT_HEAD.md]

---

**REMEMBER:** Check this file at the start of every session!
EOF

# Cleanup temp files
rm TODO_URGENT_HEAD.md TODO_URGENT_LOCAL.md
```

---

## Verification

After merging, verify:

```bash
# Check file compiles/renders properly
cat TODO_URGENT.md | head -50

# Check for merge conflict markers (should be none)
grep -n "<<<<<<" TODO_URGENT.md
grep -n ">>>>>>>" TODO_URGENT.md
grep -n "=======" TODO_URGENT.md

# Stage the merged file
git add TODO_URGENT.md

# Verify staged
git diff --cached TODO_URGENT.md | head -20
```

---

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Duplicate Headings
**Problem:** Both sections have "## TODO URGENT"
**Solution:** Rename second heading to "## HISTORICAL SESSIONS"

### Issue 2: Date Confusion
**Problem:** September 24, 2025 is in the future (today is January 13, 2025)
**Solution:** This is likely a typo. Change to "September 24, 2024" or keep as-is for now.

### Issue 3: Conflicting Timelines
**Problem:** Both sections have timeline sections
**Solution:** Merge timelines or keep most recent only.

---

## Final Check

Before committing:

‚úÖ File has no merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
‚úÖ Both sessions documented (September + January)
‚úÖ Dates are correct (or noted as needing correction)
‚úÖ File structure is clean and readable
‚úÖ Updated date shows January 13, 2025

---

## Example Final Result

```markdown
# TODO URGENT - Critical Development Priorities
**Created:** 2025-09-24
**Updated:** 2025-01-13
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Top Priority Items
