## 🎯 Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring Strategy

**Display Order** (Left to Right):
```
ENTERPRISE → TRAINER PRO → TRAINER
$399          $299 ⭐         $199
```

**Why?**
- Enterprise ($399) creates high anchor
- Trainer Pro ($299) appears moderate
- Trainer ($199) seems like a deal

**Expected Outcome:**
- 45% choose Trainer Pro (middle option)
- 40% choose Trainer (budget-conscious)
- 15% choose Enterprise (high-value seekers)

---

### Decoy Pricing Effect

**Trainer Pro as "Goldilocks":**
- Too cheap: Trainer ($199)
- Too expensive: Enterprise ($399)
- **Just right: Trainer Pro ($299)** ← Target

**Messaging:**
"Most trainers choose Trainer Pro—it's the perfect balance of features and value."

---

### Loss Aversion Framing

**Bad Messaging:**
❌ "Pay $199 upfront"

**Good Messaging:**
✅ "Get **LIFETIME ACCESS** for just $199"
✅ "Pay once, use **FOREVER**"
✅ "No monthly bills. **EVER.**"

---

### Urgency Without Scarcity

**Scarcity creates pressure** (avoid):
❌ "Only 50 spots left!"
❌ "Limited time offer ends tonight!"

**Value-based urgency** (use):
✅ "Lock in your price before we increase it for new customers"
✅ "Early adopters get lifetime access at $199-$399"
✅ "Join 10,000+ trainers who quit subscriptions"

---

## 💡 Value Proposition Framework

### Core Message
**"Pay Once. Plan Forever. Save $2,000+ vs Subscriptions"**

### Supporting Messages
1. **Affordability**: "Less than 2 months of competitor subscriptions"
2. **Ownership**: "It's yours forever—no renewal anxiety"
3. **Predictability**: "One-time cost, unlimited time value"
4. **Freedom**: "Quit subscription fatigue for good"
5. **ROI**: "Pays for itself with 2-4 clients"

### FAQ Section

**Q: What happens after I pay?**
A: You get instant lifetime access. Use it for 1 year, 5 years, 10 years—no additional payments ever.
