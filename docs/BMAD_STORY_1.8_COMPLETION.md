### Components Created/Enhanced

#### 1. **ResponsiveTable Component** (`ui/ResponsiveTable.tsx`)
- Automatic table/card switching at breakpoints
- Mobile card views with touch optimization
- Horizontal scroll for wide tables
- Reusable wrapper for all data tables

#### 2. **RecipeTableResponsive Component** (`RecipeTableResponsive.tsx`)
- Mobile-optimized recipe cards
- Desktop table view with full data
- Touch-friendly actions
- Performance optimized with memoization

#### 3. **MobileNavigation Component** (Enhanced)
- Fixed header with hamburger menu
- Bottom navigation bar (5 items)
- Slide-out drawer (300ms animation)

- `mobile-fixes.css`: Critical mobile fixes (iOS zoom, touch targets)

### Technical Implementation

#### Breakpoint System
```css
--breakpoint-xs: 375px;   /* iPhone SE */
--breakpoint-sm: 640px;   /* Large phones */
--breakpoint-md: 768px;   /* Tablets */
--breakpoint-lg: 1024px;  /* Desktop threshold */
--breakpoint-xl: 1280px;  /* Large screens */
--breakpoint-2xl: 1536px; /* Ultra-wide */
```

#### Mobile-First Approach
- Base styles for mobile
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Graceful degradation for older devices

#### Touch Optimization
