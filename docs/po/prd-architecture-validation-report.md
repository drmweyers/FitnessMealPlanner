## 🔍 Gap Analysis

### Identified Gaps: NONE ✅

All requirements have corresponding architecture components and implementation guidance.

### Potential Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP)

1. **Internationalization** (Future)
   - Manual meal plan parser currently English-only
   - Category names hardcoded in English
   - **Recommendation:** Add to backlog for Phase 5

2. **Custom Image Upload** (Future)
   - Trainers cannot upload custom images for categories
   - Limited to pre-configured image pools
   - **Recommendation:** Add to backlog for Phase 5

3. **AI-Powered Category Detection** (Future)
   - Parser uses regex-based category detection
   - Could be enhanced with OpenAI for better accuracy
   - **Recommendation:** Track usage first, enhance if needed

4. **Image Editing/Cropping** (Future)
   - No ability to edit/crop category images
   - **Recommendation:** Low priority, add to backlog
