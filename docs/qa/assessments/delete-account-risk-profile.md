## Risk Categories

### 1. Data Integrity Risks ðŸ”´ CRITICAL

**Risk:** Cascade deletes may leave orphaned records or delete unintended data

**Affected Tables:**
- âœ… `users` (primary deletion target)
- âœ… `personalized_meal_plans` (customer-specific plans)
- âœ… `meal_plan_assignments` (trainer-customer assignments)
- âœ… `grocery_lists` (customer shopping lists)
- âœ… `customer_invitations` (pending invitations)
- âœ… `customer_measurements` (progress tracking)
- âœ… `customer_photos` (progress photos)
- âœ… `customer_goals` (fitness goals)

**Severity:** ðŸ”´ P0 (Critical)
**Likelihood:** Medium (without proper implementation)
**Impact:** Data loss, referential integrity violations, broken relationships

**Mitigation:**
1. Use database transactions (all-or-nothing deletion)
2. Implement cascade deletes at database level (foreign keys)
3. Add application-level cascade verification
4. Create comprehensive unit tests for each cascade path
5. Add rollback capability with soft deletes (optional)

---

### 2. S3 Storage Cleanup Risks ðŸŸ  HIGH

**Risk:** User profile images and progress photos remain in S3 after account deletion

**Affected Resources:**
- Profile images: `s3://pti/profile-images/{userId}/*`
- Progress photos: `s3://pti/progress-photos/{userId}/*`

**Severity:** ðŸŸ  P1 (High)
**Likelihood:** High (without explicit cleanup)
**Impact:** Storage costs, privacy violations (GDPR), data retention policy violations

**Mitigation:**
1. Implement S3 cleanup service
2. Delete all user-uploaded images before account deletion
3. Add retry mechanism for failed S3 deletions
4. Log all S3 cleanup operations
5. Add manual cleanup fallback for edge cases

---

### 3. Authorization & Security Risks ðŸŸ  HIGH

**Risk:** User deletes wrong account or unauthorized deletion

**Scenarios:**
- Customer accidentally deletes their account
- Admin deletes customer account without permission
- Trainer attempts to delete customer account
- CSRF attack triggers account deletion

**Severity:** ðŸŸ  P1 (High)
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Permanent data loss, legal issues, user dissatisfaction

**Mitigation:**
1. Require password re-authentication before deletion
2. Add confirmation dialog with warning message
3. Enforce RBAC: Only customer can delete their own account
4. Add CSRF protection to delete endpoint
5. Implement 30-day soft delete with recovery period (optional)
6. Send confirmation email after deletion

---

### 4. Trainer-Customer Relationship Risks ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM

**Risk:** Deleting customer affects trainer's meal plans and data

**Scenarios:**
- Trainer loses access to customer's meal plan history

- Trainer's recipe usage data affected

**Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ P2 (Medium)
**Likelihood:** High (expected behavior)
**Impact:** Trainer workflow disruption, data loss for business analytics

**Mitigation:**
1. Notify trainer when customer deletes account
2. Preserve trainer's meal plan templates (not customer-specific)
3. Archive customer data for 30 days (optional)
4. Document expected behavior in trainer documentation
5. Add warning in UI about impact on trainer relationship

### 5. GDPR & Privacy Compliance Risks ðŸŸ¢ LOW (if implemented correctly)

**Risk:** Failure to comply with GDPR "Right to be Forgotten"

**Requirements:**
- âœ… User must be able to delete their account
- âœ… All personal data must be removed
- âœ… Data must be removed within 30 days
- âœ… Anonymized analytics data may be retained

**Severity:** ðŸ”´ P0 (Legal requirement)
**Likelihood:** Low (with proper implementation)
**Impact:** Legal penalties, fines, reputation damage

**Mitigation:**
1. Implement complete data deletion (hard delete)
2. Remove all PII from all systems
3. Clean up S3 images
4. Anonymize any retained analytics data
5. Document compliance in privacy policy
6. Add deletion confirmation email

---

### 6. Testing & QA Risks ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM

**Risk:** Incomplete test coverage leaves edge cases untested

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
- âœ… Customer with meal plans deletes account
- âœ… Customer with grocery lists deletes account
- âœ… Customer with progress tracking deletes account
- âœ… Customer with pending invitation deletes account
- âœ… Customer with S3 images deletes account
- âœ… Failed S3 deletion handling
- âœ… Database transaction rollback on error
- âœ… Authorization enforcement (non-owner cannot delete)
- âœ… CSRF protection validation
- âœ… Concurrent deletion attempts

**Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ P2 (Medium)
**Likelihood:** High (without proper test plan)
**Impact:** Bugs in production, data integrity issues

**Mitigation:**
1. Create comprehensive unit test suite (8 tables Ã— 3 scenarios = 24 tests)
2. Create E2E test suite (10 critical workflows)
3. Test cascade deletes in isolation
4. Test S3 cleanup in isolation
5. Test authorization boundaries
6. Test transaction rollback scenarios
7. Use BMAD workflow for systematic test design

---

### 7. Performance & Scalability Risks ðŸŸ¢ LOW

**Risk:** Account deletion takes too long or times out

**Scenarios:**
- Customer with 1000+ progress photos
- Customer with 100+ meal plans
- S3 deletion times out
- Database transaction locks

**Severity:** ðŸŸ¢ P3 (Low)
**Likelihood:** Low (most customers have modest data)
**Impact:** Poor UX, timeout errors

**Mitigation:**
1. Implement async deletion (background job)
2. Add progress indicator for user
3. Set reasonable timeout limits
4. Use batch S3 deletion (100 objects at a time)
5. Monitor deletion performance in production

---

### 8. Rollback & Recovery Risks ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM

**Risk:** Cannot recover from accidental deletion

**Scenarios:**
- User clicks delete by mistake
- User regrets deletion immediately
- Trainer needs customer data after deletion

**Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ P2 (Medium)
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Permanent data loss, user dissatisfaction

**Mitigation:**
1. Implement 30-day soft delete (optional - not required for MVP)
2. Add "Are you sure?" confirmation with delay
3. Send confirmation email with recovery link (if soft delete)
4. Document deletion as permanent (if hard delete)
5. Add warning: "This action cannot be undone"
