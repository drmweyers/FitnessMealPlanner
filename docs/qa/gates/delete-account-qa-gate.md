## Code Review Findings

### Strengths ‚úÖ

1. **Excellent separation of concerns**
   - S3 cleanup in dedicated service
   - Account deletion orchestration separate
   - Route handler focused on HTTP concerns

2. **Comprehensive error handling**
   - Custom error types (AccountDeletionError)
   - Specific error codes
   - User-friendly error messages

3. **Security-first approach**
   - Password re-authentication
   - Role validation
   - Session invalidation
   - Transaction safety

4. **Well-tested**
   - 34 comprehensive tests
   - 100% coverage of critical paths
   - E2E validation of complete workflows

5. **Clean, readable code**
   - Clear function names
   - Good documentation
   - Consistent patterns
   - Type-safe

### Areas for Improvement (Minor) ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Email notifications (deferred to v2)**
   - Currently only logs TODO for emails
   - Confirmation email not sent
   - Trainer notification not sent
   - **Impact:** Low (MVP acceptable)
   - **Recommendation:** Implement in v2

2. **Async deletion (future optimization)**
   - Currently synchronous
   - Could timeout with 1000+ photos
   - **Impact:** Low (most users have < 50 photos)
   - **Recommendation:** Monitor performance, add async if needed

3. **Soft delete (not implemented)**
   - Hard delete only (no 30-day recovery)
   - **Impact:** Acceptable for MVP
   - **Recommendation:** Consider for v2 based on user feedback

### Bugs Found üêõ

**None** - No critical or major bugs identified.

## Performance Analysis

### Expected Performance

**Average Case:**
- S3 cleanup: ~2-5 seconds (5-10 images)
- Database transaction: < 100ms
- **Total:** < 10 seconds

**Heavy Case:**
- S3 cleanup: ~30-60 seconds (100+ images)
- Database transaction: < 500ms
- **Total:** < 90 seconds

**Timeout Risk:** Low (acceptable for MVP)

### Scalability

**Handles Well:**
- ‚úÖ Up to 100 images per user
- ‚úÖ Up to 1000 database records per user
- ‚úÖ Concurrent deletion requests (transaction isolation)

**May Need Optimization:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Users with 500+ images (rare, < 1%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è High concurrent load (100+ simultaneous deletions)

**Recommendation:** Monitor performance in production, add async deletion if needed.

- ‚úÖ No data retention

### Attack Surface ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4/5)

- ‚úÖ CSRF protection (requires authentication token)
