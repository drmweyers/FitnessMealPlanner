## API Design and Integration

### API Integration Strategy

**API Integration Strategy:** Extend existing RESTful patterns with consistent endpoint structure, maintaining current authentication middleware and response formatting standards

**Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with multi-provider support (local + Google OAuth), role-based authorization middleware, and session management through PostgreSQL-backed sessions

**Versioning:** Currently implicit v1 API with stable endpoints; future API changes should maintain backward compatibility or implement explicit versioning (e.g., `/api/v2/`) if breaking changes are required

### API Design Strengths

**Consistent Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "success|error",
  "data": {},
  "message": "",
  "errors": []
}
```

**Role-Based Access Control:**
- Public endpoints for recipe browsing
- Authenticated endpoints for meal plan generation  
- Admin-only endpoints for content management
- Trainer-specific endpoints for client management

---

## External API Integration

### Current External APIs

**OpenAI API**
- **Purpose:** AI-powered recipe generation and natural language meal plan parsing
- **Integration Method:** Server-side integration through dedicated service layer
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive retry logic, rate limiting awareness, and graceful fallback strategies

**Google OAuth 2.0 API**
- **Purpose:** Alternative authentication method for user registration and login
- **Integration Method:** Passport.js strategy integration with session management

**AWS S3 Compatible API (DigitalOcean Spaces)**
- **Purpose:** Production file storage for progress photos and profile images
- **Integration Method:** AWS SDK integration with environment-based configuration

**Resend Email API**
- **Purpose:** Transactional email delivery for user invitations and notifications
- **Integration Method:** Direct API integration through email service layer

---

## Source Tree Integration

### Integration Guidelines

**File Naming Consistency:**
- **React Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `MealPlanGenerator.tsx`)
- **TypeScript Files**: camelCase (e.g., `recipeService.ts`)
- **API Routes**: camelCase with 'Routes' suffix (e.g., `mealPlanRoutes.ts`)
- **Database Schema**: camelCase for entities (e.g., `personalizedMealPlans`)

**Folder Organization Approach:**
- **Feature-based grouping** for complex components with multiple files
- **Type-based grouping** for simple, reusable components
- **Barrel exports** (`index.ts`) for clean imports
- **Consistent depth** - avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels recommended)
