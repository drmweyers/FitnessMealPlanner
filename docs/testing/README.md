## 🐛 Known Issues & Testing Focus

### 1. Recipe Generation Hanging (Fixed)
- **Issue**: Generation would stall at 80% during image generation
- **Fix**: Implemented placeholder images with background generation
- **Test**: Verify recipes save quickly (<5s) with placeholders
- **Test File**: `test/unit/services/recipeGenerator.test.ts`

### 2. OpenAI Rate Limiting
- **Issue**: API rate limits causing generation failures
- **Fix**: Exponential backoff retry logic
- **Test**: Simulate rate limit errors and verify retry mechanism
- **Test File**: `test/unit/services/recipeGenerator.test.ts`

### 3. Cache Invalidation
- **Issue**: Stale recipe data after generation
- **Fix**: Explicit cache invalidation triggers
- **Test**: Verify cache cleared and data refetched
- **Test File**: `test/unit/components/AdminRecipeGenerator.test.tsx`

### 4. Progress Tracking
- **Issue**: Progress bar accuracy
- **Fix**: Server-sent events for real-time updates
- **Test**: Verify progress updates match backend status
- **Test File**: `test/e2e/admin-recipe-generation.spec.ts`
