### Do I need to do anything to maintain grandfather status?

**No!** Your grandfather status is automatic and permanent. No action needed on your part.

Technically yes, but **we don't recommend it** because:

**Why would you pay for something you already have?**

### What if I delete my account?

⚠️ **Warning:** If you delete your account, you lose grandfather status permanently.
