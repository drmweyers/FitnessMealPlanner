## Template 1: Gym Software Integration Partnership

**Target Companies:** Trainerize, My PT Hub, PT Distinction, Mindbody, Zen Planner

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "Partnership opportunity: Add nutrition to [Company Name]"
2. "[Company Name] + EvoFitMeals = Complete trainer platform"
3. "Your trainers are asking for meal planning. We have the solution."

**Email Body:**

```
Subject: Partnership opportunity: Add nutrition to [Company Name]

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because I noticed [Company Name] offers [Feature A] and [Feature B] for fitness professionals, but doesn't currently have a built-in nutrition/meal planning solution.

We've been talking to trainers using your platform, and this is their #1 feature request.

**About EvoFitMeals:**
We built an AI-powered meal planning platform specifically for fitness trainers. It generates custom meal plans in 60 seconds, manages unlimited clients, and exports professional PDFs.

**Why this partnership makes sense:**

1. **Your trainers want it** - 68% of trainers say they need nutrition tools but don't have them
2. **Revenue share for you** - 30% of every sale through your platform
3. **Zero work for you** - We handle development, support, and maintenance
4. **Better retention** - Trainers with complete platforms (training + nutrition) churn 40% less

**What we're proposing:**

- White-label EvoFitMeals for [Company Name] users
- Deep integration with your platform (API access)
- Co-marketing to both audiences (50K+ combined reach)
- You earn 30% recurring revenue on every sale
- Optional: [Company Name]-branded meal planning feature

**Quick stats:**
- 2,000+ trainers already using EvoFitMeals
- 4.8/5 average rating
- 60-second meal plan generation
- $199-$399 one-time pricing (or custom pricing for your platform)

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore this?

I can show you the platform, share case studies, and discuss integration options.

## Template 2: Certification Program Partnership

**Target Programs:** NASM, ACE, ISSA, Precision Nutrition Level 1

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "Student discount program for [Certification] grads"
2. "Add meal planning tools to [Certification] curriculum"
3. "Partnership: Help [Certification] students succeed"

**Email Body:**

```
Subject: Student discount program for [Certification] grads

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out to explore a partnership between EvoFitMeals and [Certification Program].

**The situation:**
Your students complete [Certification] and start working with clients. Within 3 months, 80% of them are manually creating meal plans in Excel/Google Sheets because they can't afford expensive nutrition software.

**Our solution:**
EvoFitMeals is an affordable ($199-$399 one-time) meal planning platform built specifically for fitness professionals. We'd like to offer your students exclusive access.

**Partnership options:**

**Option 1: Student Discount Program**
- 40% off EvoFitMeals for all [Certification] graduates
- Lifetime discount (not just first month)
- Exclusive access to "Student Success Pack" (templates, guides)
- No cost to you

**Option 2: Curriculum Integration**
- Include EvoFitMeals in [Certification] coursework
- Students use it for meal planning assignments
- Graduate with hands-on software experience
- We provide educational materials + instructor support

**Option 3: Co-Branded Offering**
- "[Certification] Nutrition Toolkit powered by EvoFitMeals"
- White-label option with your branding
- You earn 20% revenue share
- Helps students succeed after certification

**Why your students will love this:**

✅ Professional tool they can actually afford
✅ Saves 20+ hours/week on meal planning
✅ Helps them retain clients longer (better service = better retention)
✅ One-time payment (not another monthly subscription)

**What we need from you:**

- Email announcement to graduates (we'll write it)
- Feature on [Certification] "Resources" page
- Optional: Mention in course materials

Would you be open to a quick call to discuss which option works best for [Certification]?

I can share case studies from trainers who went through similar certifications and are now using EvoFitMeals successfully.

## Template 3: Gym/Studio Partnership (B2B)

**Target:** Individual gym owners, boutique studios, franchises

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "Add $5K/month nutrition revenue to [Gym Name]"
2. "Nutrition services without hiring a nutritionist"
3. "How [Competitor Gym] added nutrition in 1 week"

**Email Body:**

```
Subject: Add $5K/month nutrition revenue to [Gym Name]

Hi [First Name],

I came across [Gym Name] on [Google/Instagram/Referral] and saw you offer [Services]. Impressive setup!

Quick question: Are you currently offering nutrition services to members?

**Most gym owners tell us:**
- Members ask about meal planning constantly
- Hiring a nutritionist is expensive ($50-80K/year)
- Trainers don't have time to create custom meal plans
- Competitors are adding nutrition and stealing members

**We built EvoFitMeals to solve this.**

It's an AI-powered meal planning platform that lets YOUR trainers deliver professional nutrition services without becoming nutritionists.

**How it works:**
1. Your trainers log in to EvoFitMeals
2. Generate custom meal plans in 60 seconds
3. Export branded PDFs with [Gym Name] logo
4. Members get professional nutrition guidance
5. You charge $50-100/month for meal plan service

**Your ROI:**
- Investment: $299-$399 one-time per trainer
- Charge: $75/month for meal plan service
- Break-even: 4-5 members sign up
- Profit: $5,000+/month with 75 members on nutrition plan

**Example:**
- 5 trainers × $299 = $1,495 investment
- 75 members × $75/month = $5,625/month revenue
- **ROI: 280% in Month 1 alone**

Would you be interested in a quick demo? I can show you how [Similar Gym] implemented this and added $8K/month in nutrition revenue.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. We offer white-label branding so meal plans look like they come from [Gym Name], not EvoFitMeals.

## Template 4: Affiliate/Influencer Partnership

**Target:** Fitness influencers, YouTubers, podcast hosts

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "Affiliate program: Earn 20% on every sale"
2. "Partnership opportunity for [Influencer Name]"
3. "Help your audience + earn recurring income"

**Email Body:**

```
Subject: Affiliate program: Earn 20% on every sale

Hi [First Name],

I've been following your content on [Platform] for a while now—your [specific content] was especially helpful.

I'm reaching out because we're launching an affiliate program for EvoFitMeals (meal planning software for trainers) and thought you'd be a great fit.

**Why this partnership makes sense:**

Your audience: Fitness trainers who need to scale their nutrition services
Our product: Software that automates meal planning + saves 20 hrs/week
Your benefit: 20% commission on every sale (+ help your audience succeed)

**Affiliate Program Details:**

✅ **20% commission per sale** ($40-80 per referral)
✅ **30-day cookie window** (you get credit for 30 days after click)
✅ **Recurring commissions** (if we add monthly pricing, you earn monthly)
✅ **Custom tracking dashboard** (see clicks, conversions, earnings in real-time)
✅ **Marketing materials provided** (banners, email templates, demo videos)
✅ **Monthly payouts** via PayPal

**Example earnings:**

- 10 referrals/month × $50 avg = $500/month
- 50 referrals/month × $50 avg = $2,500/month
- 100 referrals/month × $50 avg = $5,000/month

**How it works:**

1. You get custom affiliate link
2. Share with your audience (videos, emails, social posts)
3. They click, try free trial, purchase
4. You earn 20% commission automatically
5. We send monthly PayPal payout

No inventory, no customer support, no fulfillment. Just share and earn.

**What we ask from you:**

- Mention EvoFitMeals in 1-2 videos/posts per month
- Honest review (we're confident you'll love it)
- Share your affiliate link in video descriptions

**Next steps:**

Want to try EvoFitMeals free first? I'll give you full access (no charge) so you can test it out and see if it's a good fit for your audience.

If you like it, we'll set up your affiliate account and get you started.

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- Personalize every email (mention specific features of their product)
- Keep it short (under 200 words for cold emails)
- Lead with their benefit, not your product
- Include social proof (stats, testimonials, case studies)
- Have a clear call-to-action (book a call, reply with questions)
- Follow up 2-3 times if no response (7-day intervals)

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't send generic mass emails
- Don't lead with features (lead with outcomes)
- Don't pitch on first email (build rapport first)
- Don't follow up more than 3 times (they're not interested)
- Don't oversell (let them ask questions)

### Response Rate Targets
- **Open rate:** 40-50% (good subject lines)
- **Response rate:** 10-15% (good targeting + copy)
- **Demo conversion:** 30-40% (response → demo)
- **Close rate:** 20-30% (demo → partnership)

### Timeline Expectations
- **Week 1:** Send initial emails (10-20 partners)
- **Week 2:** Follow up with non-responders
- **Week 3:** Demo calls with interested partners
- **Week 4:** Negotiate terms, send agreements
- **Week 5-8:** Close 1-2 partnerships
