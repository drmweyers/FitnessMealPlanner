# Manual Planning vs. EvoFitMeals

Who this is for
- Trainers who currently plan in spreadsheets or text docs and want to scale quality and capacity

Quick comparison

| Dimension | Manual Planning | EvoFitMeals |
|---|---|---|
| Time per plan | ~3 hours | ~3 minutes (500+ recipes in ~60 seconds, then customize) |
| Variety | Limited by time | Very high; large recipe pool per constraints |
| Consistency | Varies by day | Standardized templates + guardrails |
| Dietary protocols | Basic | 8+ supported |
| Client capacity | 20–30 typical | Scale to 200+ clients |
| Professional export | Manual docs | Branded PDFs in one click |

When to choose manual
- Highly experimental clients where manual culinary R&D is the service
- Short-term or single-client projects

When to choose EvoFitMeals
- You need to save 15+ hours/week and scale beyond 30 clients
- You want consistent, branded outputs without hiring

Migration checklist
- Define your core protocol presets (e.g., cut, recomp, bulk)
- Create brand kit and export template
- Import clients and tag by segment
- Build a 10-meal “starter pack” for each segment
- Schedule a weekly plan refresh cadence

Notes
- Performance figures are typical but can vary by plan complexity and connection speed.
