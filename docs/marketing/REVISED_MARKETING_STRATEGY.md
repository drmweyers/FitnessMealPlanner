## Pricing Strategy

### Current Pricing Structure
- **Starter:** $199 (9 clients, core features)
- **Professional:** $299 (20 clients, advanced features)
- **Enterprise:** $399 (50 clients, all features)

### Pricing Strategy Rationale

**Why One-Time Payment Works:**
1. **Lower barrier to entry:** Trainers avoid subscription fatigue
2. **Competitive advantage:** Competitors charge $9-$18/mo = $108-$216/year
3. **Viral marketing:** "Pay once, use forever" is shareable
4. **Cash flow:** Immediate revenue vs waiting for MRR buildup

**Why This Might Not Work:**
1. **LTV concerns:** Need high volume to match MRR competitors
2. **Feature parity:** Can't fund continuous development as easily
3. **Churn invisible:** Don't know when customers stop using product

### Revised Pricing Recommendation

**Hybrid Model (Implement in Q2 2025):**

**Option A: Freemium + Premium**
- **Free:** 3 clients, basic meal plans, EvoFitMeals branding
- **Pro:** $29/mo (15 clients, remove branding, advanced features)
- **Business:** $79/mo (unlimited clients, white-label, priority support)

**Option B: Annual Pricing**
- **Starter:** $199/year (9 clients)
- **Professional:** $299/year (20 clients)
- **Enterprise:** $499/year (50 clients)
- **Lifetime:** $999 one-time (unlimited, grandfathered)

**Recommended Path:** Start with Option B (annual pricing) in Q2, test Option A (freemium) in Q3.

### Price Anchoring Strategy

**Landing Page Messaging:**
"Most meal planning software costs $18/month = $216/year. EvoFitMeals is $199 one-time. **Save $2,000+ over 10 years.**"

**Upsell Path:**
- Starter ($199) → Professional ($100 upgrade) → Enterprise ($100 upgrade)
- **Total potential:** $399 per customer
