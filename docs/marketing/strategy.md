# EvoFitMeals Marketing Strategy

Last updated: 2025-11-03

Executive summary
- Goal: grow qualified free trials and paid conversions for fitness professionals by pairing strong positioning with a repeatable demand engine.
- Focus: outcomes (time saved, client capacity, revenue) over "AI" as the hero.

Objectives (12 weeks)
- 1,000 free-trial signups; 25% activation (first plan generated); 15% trial-to-paid; CAC:LTV ≥ 1:3; <3% monthly logo churn.

Ideal customer profiles (ICPs)
1) New trainers: need professional tools fast; message: launch-ready in a day, low lift.
2) Established trainers: time-poor, demand scalability; message: save 20+ hrs/wk and handle 3× more clients without hiring.
3) Gym owners/teams: add nutrition revenue; message: turnkey service with team workflows.
4) Online coaches: remote-first; message: personalization at scale and branded exports.

Positioning and value prop
- Positioning: EvoFitMeals is the AI-powered nutrition platform for fitness professionals to deliver personalized meal planning at scale.
- Pillars: Time savings, Scale, Quality/Professional outputs, ROI, Support.
- Proof to maintain: testimonials, usage metrics, speed/throughput benchmarks.

Messaging guardrails
- Emphasize "AI-powered" and "personalized"; avoid implying coach replacement.
- Keep claims consistent across surfaces (no mix of "unlimited" vs "200+" vs "100+").

GTM plan by funnel stage
Awareness
- Paid search: terms like "meal planning software for trainers", "nutrition coach software", "AI meal plan generator".
- Paid social (video-first): YouTube/Meta 30s spot demonstrating 3-minute workflow.
- Organic social: LinkedIn thought leadership 2–3×/wk; Instagram Reels/features 3×/wk; X threads weekly.
- Partnerships: cert orgs, coaching academies, gym software vendors; rev-share affiliates (20% recurring).
- PR: announce milestones and case studies; thought-leadership by founder.

Consideration
- Landing page with benefits-led hero, feature demos, real social proof, and risk-reduced trial.
- Case studies by segment (solo trainer, gym, online coach) with quantified outcomes.
- Webinar/demo monthly; live Q&A and downloadable checklist.
- Comparison pages: EvoFitMeals vs manual planning; vs alternatives.

Conversion
- Free 14-day trial, no credit card if possible; in-product guided checklist to activation.
- Pricing clarity and value framing; annual savings; money-back guarantee where applicable.
- Exit-intent and cart-recovery sequences; concierge onboarding option for teams.

Retention/expansion
- Onboarding emails matching in-app milestones (first plan, first export, first client onboarded).
- Weekly "Recipe Pack of the Week" and tips; monthly feature highlights.
- NPS + review program; referral rewards for coaches.

Content plan (first 8 weeks)
- Hero/demo video: 30-second ad and 2-minute demo (see MARKETING_COPY).
- 3 segment-specific case studies with metrics.
- Blog editorial (8 posts):
  1) How AI is revolutionizing fitness (for trainers)
  2) Hidden cost of manual meal planning
  3) 3-minute meal plan method
  4) Personalization at scale: what clients want
  5) Building nutrition revenue for gyms
  6) Client retention via variety and compliance
  7) Macro balance and dietary protocols guide
  8) Software checklist for nutrition coaches

Offers and promos
- Always-on: 14-day free trial.
- Quarterly: "New Year" or seasonal promos with limited-time discount; ensure integrity and caps.

Measurement and instrumentation
- Core events: visit_lp, start_trial, activate (first plan generated), export_pdf, add_first_client, upgrade_paid, invite_team, churn.
- Channel tracking with UTMs; dashboard by channel and stage; weekly review cadence.
- Benchmarks: CPL by channel, trial→paid, activation within 24h, first-value time, payback period.

Experiment backlog (prioritized)
- Hero headline A/B: three options in MARKETING_COPY; measure CTR to signup and activation.
- Trial length: 14 vs 7 days; with/without CC requirement.
- Pricing endings: $47/$97/$297 vs $49/$99/$299; annual default toggle on.
- Demo above-the-fold vs below; social proof density high vs medium.
- Ad creatives: feature-first vs outcome-first; testimonial overlays vs plain.

Assets checklist
- Existing: [Messaging guide](../../MARKETING_COPY.md), [Checklist](../../.bmad-creative-writing/checklists/marketing-copy-checklist.md), Video script templates in guide.
- To produce: brand kit, screenshots library, case studies (3), product one-pager, comparison pages, ad creative set (search/display), webinar deck.

Risks and mitigations
- Substantiation: ensure metrics like "10,000+ users", "20 hrs saved", "92% retention", "500 recipes in 60s" have current evidence; otherwise soften or add "up to", "on average", or remove.
- Consistency: standardize client capacity language (e.g., "Scale to 200+ clients") across all assets.
- Compliance: avoid guaranteed income claims; add footnotes where needed.

90-day plan (high level)
- Weeks 1–2: finalize positioning, instrument analytics, ship updated LP, produce demo video.
- Weeks 3–4: launch search + YouTube; publish 4 blogs; ship case study #1; begin affiliate program.
- Weeks 5–8: webinar #1, case studies #2–#3, comparison pages, iterate ads.
