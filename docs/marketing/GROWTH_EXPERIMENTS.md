**Email 1: Problem-Focused**
```
Subject: Do you spend 3+ hours on meal plans each week?

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you offer nutrition coaching on your website. Quick question: How long does it take you to create customized meal plans for each client?

Most trainers I talk to spend 3-5 hours per week manually calculating macros and building meal plans. That's 15-20 hours per month that could be spent training clients or growing your business.

We built an AI tool that cuts meal planning time from 3 hours to 10 minutes per client. Curious if this would be helpful for you?

If so, I'd be happy to show you a quick 10-minute demo.

Best,
[Your Name]
FitnessMealPlanner
```

**Email 2: Social Proof**
```
Subject: How [Trainer Name] saves 15 hours/week on meal planning

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email from Tuesday. Wanted to share a quick case study that might be relevant.

[Trainer Name] used to spend 20 hours/month creating meal plans for his 15 clients. Now he uses our AI tool and spends < 5 hours/month. That's 15 hours saved—time he now spends on sales calls and new client acquisition.

Result: He added 5 new clients in 2 months (from the extra time freed up).

Would this kind of time savings be valuable for your business?

Happy to show you exactly how it works (10-minute screen share).

Let me know,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 3: Break-Up Email (Final)**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing now isn't the right time for you to streamline your meal planning process.

Before I close your file, I wanted to send one last resource: [link to free 30 meal plans lead magnet from Experiment #2]

No strings attached—just a helpful resource for trainers like you.

If you ever want to chat about AI meal planning in the future, feel free to reach out.

Cheers,
[Your Name]

## Risk Mitigation
