## Sales Scripts & Templates

### Script 1: Cold Outreach (Partnerships)

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: Add Nutrition to [Gym Software]

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Gym Software] offers [Feature A] and [Feature B], but doesn't currently have a nutrition/meal planning solution. Many trainers using your platform ask for this.

We built EvoFitMeals specifically for fitness professionals. It generates custom meal plans in 60 seconds using AI, and we're looking for integration partners.

**What we're proposing:**
- White-label EvoFitMeals for your users
- You earn 30% revenue share on every sale
- We handle all support and maintenance
- Co-marketing to both our audiences

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore this?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Title], EvoFitMeals

### Script 2: Trial Follow-Up Call

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from EvoFitMeals. I saw you signed up for our trial last week. Do you have 5 minutes to chat about your experience?"

1. "What made you start looking for meal planning software?"
2. "What's your current process for creating meal plans?"
3. "How many clients are you serving right now?"
4. "Have you had a chance to try creating a meal plan in EvoFitMeals?"
5. "What would make this a no-brainer purchase for you?"

**Demo (if they haven't tried it):**
"Let me show you how to create a meal plan in 60 seconds. Can you pull up the app while we're on the call?"

**Objection Handling:**

**Objection:** "It's too expensive."
**Response:** "I totally understand. Let me ask—how much time do you currently spend creating meal plans each week?"
[Wait for answer: usually 3-5 hours]
"So if you bill at $75/hour, that's $225-$375 of your time per week. EvoFitMeals pays for itself in the first week. Plus, it's a one-time payment, not a monthly subscription."

**Objection:** "I need to think about it."
**Response:** "Absolutely. What specifically are you thinking about? Is it the price, the features, or something else?"
[Uncover real objection and address it]

**Close:**
"Based on what you've told me, it sounds like EvoFitMeals could save you [X hours/week] and help you [their stated goal]. What's holding you back from getting started today?"

- **Option B:** Team license (10 trainers, $1,500 annual)
- **Option C:** White-label + team license ($3,500 annual + revenue share)

"Which option makes the most sense for your gym?"

**Objection Handling:**

**Objection:** "I need to talk to my trainers first."
**Response:** "Great idea. What if we set up a 15-minute demo for your trainers next week? I'll walk them through it, and then you can make a decision together."

Hi [Name],

Congrats! You've maxed out your 9 clients on the Starter plan. That's a great problem to have.

## Objection Handling Framework

### Objection 1: "It's too expensive."

**Underlying Concern:** Price sensitivity, unclear ROI

**Response Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge:** "I totally understand. Budget is always a consideration."
2. **Reframe:** "Let me ask—how much time do you spend creating meal plans each week?"
3. **Calculate ROI:** "[X hours/week] × [your hourly rate] = [$Y/week]. EvoFitMeals pays for itself in [timeframe]."
4. **Contrast:** "Most meal planning software costs $18/month = $216/year. We're $199 one-time."
5. **Risk Reversal:** "Plus, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If it doesn't save you time, get a full refund."

**Follow-Up Question:**
"If I could show you how this pays for itself in 2 weeks, would that change your perspective?"

---

### Objection 2: "I can do this myself with Excel/Google Sheets."

**Underlying Concern:** Believes manual process is sufficient

**Response Framework:**
1. **Validate:** "You're absolutely right—you can create meal plans manually."
2. **Opportunity Cost:** "But the real question is: should you? Your time is worth [$X/hour]. Is meal planning the best use of that time?"
3. **Quality:** "Plus, EvoFitMeals generates professional PDFs with nutrition labels, grocery lists, and your branding. How long does that take in Excel?"
4. **Scale:** "And what happens when you have 10 clients? 20 clients? Can you still do it manually without working weekends?"

**Follow-Up Question:**
"If you could automate this and get your weekends back, would that be valuable to you?"

---

### Objection 3: "My clients won't follow meal plans anyway."

**Underlying Concern:** Low perceived value of nutrition coaching

**Response Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge:** "I hear you. Compliance is definitely a challenge."
2. **Reframe:** "But that's exactly why you need better tools. Clients don't follow generic templates. They follow plans that feel personalized to them."
3. **Data:** "Our customers report 40% higher client retention when they add meal planning. Why? Because clients see faster results."
4. **Social Proof:** "Here's what [Trainer Name] said: [Testimonial about client compliance]."

**Follow-Up Question:**
"What if adding meal plans helped you keep clients 6 months longer? What would that be worth to your business?"

---

### Objection 4: "I need to think about it."

**Underlying Concern:** Stalling tactic, needs more info, or has unspoken objection

**Response Framework:**
1. **Permission to Probe:** "Of course. Can I ask—what specifically are you thinking about?"
2. **Uncover Real Objection:** [Wait for answer. Common responses: price, features, timing]
3. **Address Directly:** [Use relevant objection handling framework]
4. **Create Urgency:** "I want to make sure you get the early adopter pricing. It expires [Date]. Would it help to schedule a follow-up call before then?"

**Follow-Up Question:**
"If I could address [their concern], would you be ready to move forward today?"

---

### Objection 5: "I'm already using [Competitor]."

**Underlying Concern:** Switching costs, fear of change

**Response Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge:** "That's great! What do you like most about [Competitor]?"
2. **Find Gaps:** "What would you change about it if you could?"
3. **Differentiate:** "Here's how EvoFitMeals is different: [unique features based on competitor comparison]."
4. **Risk-Free Trial:** "Would you be open to trying EvoFitMeals alongside [Competitor] for 2 weeks? No commitment. See which one you prefer."

**Follow-Up Question:**
"If EvoFitMeals could do everything [Competitor] does, plus [unique benefit], would you consider switching?"
