## Development Workflow

### MANDATORY SESSION INSTRUCTIONS
**Always read PLANNING.md at the start of every new conversation, check TASKS.md before starting your work, mark completed tasks to TASKS.md immediately, and add newly discovered tasks to TASKS.md when found.**

### Before Starting Any Development Task
1. **ALWAYS** ensure you're on main branch: `git checkout main`
2. **ALWAYS** start Docker development environment first
3. Check git status: `git status`
4. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
5. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<description>` (from main)

### Branch Management Commands
```bash
# Always start from main (current production branch)
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# For feature work
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# ... do work ...
git add .
git commit -m "your changes"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Merge back to main when ready (for production deployment)
git checkout main
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin main
```

### Branch Synchronization Process (CTO Guidance)
**CRITICAL: After adding features to main, synchronize with qa-ready**

```bash
# Step 1: Ensure you're on main with latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Step 2: Switch to qa-ready branch  
git checkout qa-ready
git status  # Must be clean

# Step 3: Merge main into qa-ready to sync branches
git merge main --no-edit
# This brings latest production code to qa-ready (like Export JSON feature)

# Step 4: Push synchronized qa-ready branch
git push origin qa-ready

# Step 5: Return to main branch
git checkout main
```

**CTO Instructions - When to guide User through this process:**
- ✅ After new features are committed to main
- ✅ Before starting development on qa-ready  
- ✅ After production hotfixes
- ✅ When user asks "is qa-ready merged with main?"
- ✅ Weekly as part of regular maintenance

**Why branch sync is important:**
- qa-ready serves as staging/development branch
- main remains production-ready branch  
- Both branches need latest features for consistent development
- Prevents conflicts when deploying from qa-ready

### During Development
1. Use TodoWrite tool to track all tasks
2. Test changes in the Docker environment
3. Run linting before commits: `npm run lint`
4. Ensure TypeScript checks pass: `npm run typecheck`

### After Task Completion
1. Test all changes thoroughly
2. Commit with descriptive messages
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Mark todos as completed

## Current Features Status

### Completed Features (main branch - Production)
- ✅ User authentication (Admin, Trainer, Customer roles)
- ✅ Recipe management system
- ✅ Meal plan generation
- ✅ Multiple meal plans per customer
- ✅ PDF export (both client-side and server-side)
- ✅ Responsive design for all pages
- ✅ Customer invitation system
- ✅ Profile image upload system for all user roles
- ✅ Customer progress tracking (measurements, photos, goals)
- ✅ Trainer-customer meal plan assignment workflow

### Health Protocol Feature Status
- **Status**: ❌ **REMOVED FROM PRODUCTION** (August 20, 2025)
- **Reason**: Feature removed per business requirements
- **Production Impact**: Successfully eliminated from https://evofitmeals.com
- **Deployment Verification**: Confirmed via comprehensive multi-agent QA review
- **Components Removed**: `TrainerHealthProtocols.tsx`, `SpecializedProtocolsPanel.tsx`
- **Database**: `trainerHealthProtocols` and `protocolAssignments` tables removed

### PDF Export Implementation
- **Client-side**: Using jsPDF in `client/src/utils/pdfExport.ts`
- **Server-side**: Using Puppeteer with EvoFit branding
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - POST `/api/pdf/export` (authenticated)
  - POST `/api/pdf/test-export` (dev only)
  - POST `/api/pdf/export/meal-plan/:planId`

## Testing Guidelines
1. **Always test in Docker environment first**
2. Use the provided test scripts for specific features
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test all user roles (Admin, Trainer, Customer)
5. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes

## 🤖 Continuous Testing Framework (NEW - January 2025)

### Overview
FitnessMealPlanner now includes a **Claude-powered autonomous testing agent** that continuously monitors and tests the Meal Plan Generator system without requiring external API calls.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Verify setup
npm run test:continuous:verify

# Start continuous testing (5-minute intervals)
npm run test:continuous

# Start with auto-fix enabled
npm run test:continuous:auto-fix
```

### Features
- ✅ **Continuous Monitoring**: Runs tests at regular intervals (default: 5 minutes)
- ✅ **Autonomous Bug Detection**: Automatically identifies failing tests
- ✅ **Auto-Fix Integration**: Integrates with Autonomous Bug Fixer to fix issues automatically
- ✅ **Comprehensive Reports**: Generates JSON reports saved to `test-results/continuous-testing/`
- ✅ **No External APIs**: Runs entirely within Claude Code

### Available Commands

```bash
# Basic continuous testing
npm run test:continuous              # Default 5-minute interval
npm run test:continuous 10           # Custom 10-minute interval

# With auto-fix
npm run test:continuous:auto-fix     # Enable autonomous bug fixing

# Test specific categories
npm run test:continuous:unit         # Unit tests only
npm run test:continuous:integration  # Integration tests only
npm run test:continuous:e2e          # E2E tests only
npm run test:continuous:all          # All tests (not just meal plan)

# Verify setup
npm run test:continuous:verify       # Check prerequisites
```

### Test Coverage

**Meal Plan Generator Tests:**
- **Unit Tests** (55 planned): Service logic, AI parsing, nutrition optimization
- **Integration Tests** (38 planned): API endpoints, workflows, assignments
- **E2E Tests** (44 planned): Complete user flows, visual regression

### Documentation

- **Quick Start**: `test/continuous-testing/QUICK_START.md`
- **Full Guide**: `test/continuous-testing/README.md`
- **Technical Spec**: `test/continuous-testing/CLAUDE_SUBAGENT_SPEC.md`

### Success Metrics

**Target Metrics:**
- ✅ Test Coverage: 95%+ for meal plan services
- ✅ Success Rate: 98%+ tests passing
- ✅ Auto-Fix Rate: 70%+ of failures fixed automatically
- ✅ Detection Time: <5 minutes to detect new failures
- ✅ Fix Time: <10 minutes from detection to verified fix

### Integration with Autonomous Bug Fixer

The continuous testing agent seamlessly integrates with the existing Autonomous Bug Fixer (`test/autonomous-fix/`):

```bash
# Auto-fix enabled: Tests → Detect → Fix → Verify → Repeat
npm run test:continuous:auto-fix
```

**Fix Levels:**
- **Level 1** (Auto-fix, no approval): Selector updates, import fixes, type errors
- **Level 2** (Auto-fix after verification): UI bugs, API fixes, performance
- **Level 3** (Requires approval): Auth logic, business logic, schema changes

### Viewing Reports

```bash
# View latest report
cat test-results/continuous-testing/latest.json | jq .

# View summary only
cat test-results/continuous-testing/latest.json | jq '.summary'

# View recent failures
cat test-results/continuous-testing/latest.json | jq '.testRuns[].failures[]'
```

## Common Issues & Solutions
- **Import errors**: Check Vite alias configuration is working
- **Database connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL container is running
- **PDF export fails**: Check Puppeteer dependencies in Docker
- **Port conflicts**: Default ports are 4000 (dev) and 5001 (prod)

## Security Considerations
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Sanitize data before PDF generation

## Production Deployment (Manual Process)

### CRITICAL: Manual Deployment Instructions for Local Repo → Production

**When Docker push fails due to proxy/network issues, use this manual deployment process:**

#### 1. Build and Tag Image Locally
```bash
# Build production image
docker build --target prod -t fitnessmealplanner:prod .

# Tag for DigitalOcean registry
docker tag fitnessmealplanner:prod registry.digitalocean.com/bci/fitnessmealplanner:prod
```

#### 2. Manual Deployment via DigitalOcean Dashboard
Since Docker push may fail due to proxy issues, use manual deployment:

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Navigate to**: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps
2. **Find App**: `fitnessmealplanner-prod` (App ID: `600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958`)
3. **Click**: on the app name to open management page
4. **Locate Deploy Button**: Look for "Deploy" (blue button, top-right) or "Actions" → "Force Rebuild and Deploy"
5. **Trigger Deployment**: Click "Deploy" or "Force Rebuild and Deploy"
6. **Confirm**: When prompted, confirm the deployment
7. **Monitor**: Watch deployment progress (3-5 minutes typical)
8. **Verify**: Check https://evofitmeals.com for successful deployment

#### 3. Deployment Configuration Details
- **App Name**: `fitnessmealplanner-prod`
- **Production URL**: https://evofitmeals.com
- **Registry**: `registry.digitalocean.com/bci/fitnessmealplanner:prod`
- **Auto-deploy**: Enabled (triggers on registry push)
- **Deployment Method**: Container Registry (not Git-based)

#### 4. Why Manual Deployment is Used
- **Proxy Issues**: Docker push fails due to corporate proxy blocking registry uploads
- **Preserves Team Workflow**: Other developers can continue using Docker push normally
- **No Configuration Changes**: Maintains existing deployment setup
- **Reliable Alternative**: Bypasses network connectivity issues

#### 5. For CCA-CTO: Always Guide Through This Process
When user requests deployment to production:
1. **First attempt**: Try Docker push (`docker push registry.digitalocean.com/bci/fitnessmealplanner:prod`)
2. **If push fails**: Guide user through manual deployment process above
3. **Reference**: Full deployment details in `DO_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

### Comprehensive Deployment Documentation

- Registry push may appear to timeout but actually succeed
- Full deployment window is 7-10 minutes from registry push to production
- Auto-deployment triggers within 4 seconds of registry update
- Production verification should wait until deployment is complete
- DigitalOcean Container Registry auto-deployment is highly reliable
- Multi-agent diagnostic approach provides comprehensive production analysis

**Multi-Agent QA Investigation Results:**
- **Production Diagnostic Agent**: Identified deployment timing issue, confirmed successful Health Protocol removal
- **QA Verification Agent**: Verified 100% Health Protocol elimination with 39ms response times
- **DevOps Documentation Agent**: Created 50+ page deployment documentation suite

- **Key Techniques for This Project**:
  - Use Serena MCP for semantic code search in this large codebase
  - Implement PRP framework for new feature development
  - Leverage sub-agents for specialized tasks (UI, backend, testing)
  - Use parallel development with git worktrees for A/B testing features
  - Apply token optimization strategies to reduce costs
  - **Multi-agent investigation approach**: Deploy specialized agents for complex production issues

## Claude Code Router Configuration

### Overview
Claude Code Router is configured to use native Claude models by default. Alternative models (like Qwen) can be used when needed.

### Running Claude Code

#### Default: Use Native Claude Models (RECOMMENDED)
```powershell
cd C:\Users\drmwe\claude-workspace\FitnessMealPlanner
claude code
```
This uses Claude models directly through your Anthropic account.

**Quick Launch Script:**
```powershell
./use-claude-default.ps1
```

#### Alternative: Use with Router Proxy (ONLY when Claude credits exhausted)
```powershell
cd C:\Users\drmwe\claude-workspace\FitnessMealPlanner
claude code --api-proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
This routes through the proxy but still uses native Claude by default.

**IMPORTANT:** If you get OpenRouter errors, ensure you're NOT using the proxy. Run `claude code` directly without any proxy arguments.

### Switching to Alternative Models

#### When Claude Credits Run Out
Switch to Qwen models using the `/model` command within Claude Code:

**Available Qwen Models:**
- `/model openrouter-qwen,qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct` - General purpose (recommended)
- `/model openrouter-qwen,qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct` - Optimized for coding
- `/model openrouter-qwen,qwen/qwq-32b-preview` - Best for reasoning tasks
- `/model openrouter-qwen,qwen/qwen-2-vl-72b-instruct` - Vision-language model

**Other Available Models via OpenRouter:**
- `/model openrouter,google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview` - Gemini Pro
- `/model openrouter,anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` - Claude via OpenRouter
- `/model openrouter,deepseek/deepseek-chat` - DeepSeek

### Quick Alias for PowerShell
Add to your PowerShell profile for quick access:
```powershell
function claude-qwen {
    claude code --api-proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 --model openrouter-qwen,qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct
}
```

### Router Service Management

#### Check Router Status
```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.CommandLine -like "*claude-code-router*"}
```

#### Restart Router Service
```powershell
# Stop existing service
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.CommandLine -like "*claude-code-router*"} | Stop-Process -Force

# Start service
Start-Process node -ArgumentList "C:\Users\drmwe\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\@musistudio\claude-code-router\dist\cli.js", "start" -NoNewWindow
```

### Configuration Location
- Router config: `~/.claude-code-router/config.json`
- Logs: `~/.claude-code-router/claude-code-router.log`

### Best Practices
1. Use native Claude models by default for all tasks
2. Only switch to alternative models (like Qwen) when absolutely necessary
3. Monitor usage to maintain optimal performance
4. Prioritize Claude models for their superior capabilities and consistency

### Model Switching (Only When Necessary)

**NOTE**: Model switching should only be used when Claude credits are exhausted or for specific testing purposes.

If you need to switch models, first ensure Claude Code is running with the router:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\drmwe\claude-workspace\FitnessMealPlanner
claude code --api-proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Then use these commands within Claude Code:

#### When you say "change to qwen3":
```
/model openrouter,qwen/qwen3-coder:free
```

#### Other Quick Commands:
- **"change to qwen coder"**: `/model openrouter-qwen,qwen/qwen-2.5-coder-32b-instruct`
- **"change to qwen general"**: `/model openrouter-qwen,qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct`
- **"change to qwen reasoning"**: `/model openrouter-qwen,qwen/qwq-32b-preview`
- **"change to local qwen"**: `/model ollama,qwen2.5-coder:latest`
- **"change to gemini"**: `/model openrouter,google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview`
- **"change to deepseek"**: `/model openrouter,deepseek/deepseek-chat`
