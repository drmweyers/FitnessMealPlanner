## 🌟 CRITICAL: BRANCH STRUCTURE UPDATE
**Current branch status after Health Protocol removal (August 2025):**

### Branch Hierarchy:
1. **main** - 🥇 PRODUCTION BRANCH (current active branch)
   - Status: Health Protocol successfully removed from production
   - Contains: All core features except Health Protocol
   - Production URL: https://evofitmeals.com
   - Last deployment: August 20, 2025

2. **qa-ready** - 🥈 Development branch (previously primary)
   - Status: Contains removed Health Protocol feature
   - Use case: Development and testing of new features
   - Branch from main for new feature development

3. **qa-ready-clean** - 🥉 Legacy branch (archived)

## CRITICAL: Development Environment Setup

### ALWAYS Start Development with Docker
1. **Check Docker is running first**: `docker ps`
2. **Start development server**: `docker-compose --profile dev up -d`
3. **Verify startup**: `docker logs fitnessmealplanner-dev --tail 20`
4. **Access points**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:4000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:4000/api
   - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432

### Docker Commands Reference
- **Start dev environment**: `docker-compose --profile dev up -d`
- **Stop dev environment**: `docker-compose --profile dev down`
- **View logs**: `docker logs fitnessmealplanner-dev -f`
- **Restart containers**: `docker-compose --profile dev restart`
- **Rebuild after dependencies change**: `docker-compose --profile dev up -d --build`

## Development Workflow

### MANDATORY SESSION INSTRUCTIONS
**Always read PLANNING.md at the start of every new conversation, check TASKS.md before starting your work, mark completed tasks to TASKS.md immediately, and add newly discovered tasks to TASKS.md when found.**

### Before Starting Any Development Task
1. **ALWAYS** ensure you're on main branch: `git checkout main`
2. **ALWAYS** start Docker development environment first
3. Check git status: `git status`
4. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
5. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<description>` (from main)

### Branch Management Commands
```bash
# Always start from main (current production branch)
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# For feature work
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# ... do work ...
git add .
git commit -m "your changes"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Merge back to main when ready (for production deployment)
git checkout main
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin main
```

### Branch Synchronization Process (CTO Guidance)
**CRITICAL: After adding features to main, synchronize with qa-ready**

```bash
# Step 1: Ensure you're on main with latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Step 2: Switch to qa-ready branch  
git checkout qa-ready
git status  # Must be clean

# Step 3: Merge main into qa-ready to sync branches
git merge main --no-edit
# This brings latest production code to qa-ready (like Export JSON feature)

# Step 4: Push synchronized qa-ready branch
git push origin qa-ready

# Step 5: Return to main branch
git checkout main
```

**CTO Instructions - When to guide User through this process:**
- ✅ After new features are committed to main
- ✅ Before starting development on qa-ready  
- ✅ After production hotfixes
- ✅ When user asks "is qa-ready merged with main?"
- ✅ Weekly as part of regular maintenance

**Why branch sync is important:**
- qa-ready serves as staging/development branch
- main remains production-ready branch  
- Both branches need latest features for consistent development
- Prevents conflicts when deploying from qa-ready

### During Development
1. Use TodoWrite tool to track all tasks
2. Test changes in the Docker environment
3. Run linting before commits: `npm run lint`
4. Ensure TypeScript checks pass: `npm run typecheck`

### After Task Completion
1. Test all changes thoroughly
2. Commit with descriptive messages
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Mark todos as completed

## Current Features Status

### Completed Features (main branch - Production)
- ✅ User authentication (Admin, Trainer, Customer roles)
- ✅ Recipe management system
- ✅ Meal plan generation
- ✅ Multiple meal plans per customer
- ✅ PDF export (both client-side and server-side)
- ✅ Responsive design for all pages
- ✅ Customer invitation system
- ✅ Profile image upload system for all user roles
- ✅ Customer progress tracking (measurements, photos, goals)
- ✅ Trainer-customer meal plan assignment workflow

### Health Protocol Feature Status
- **Status**: ❌ **REMOVED FROM PRODUCTION** (August 20, 2025)
- **Reason**: Feature removed per business requirements
- **Production Impact**: Successfully eliminated from https://evofitmeals.com
- **Deployment Verification**: Confirmed via comprehensive multi-agent QA review
- **Components Removed**: `TrainerHealthProtocols.tsx`, `SpecializedProtocolsPanel.tsx`
- **Database**: `trainerHealthProtocols` and `protocolAssignments` tables removed

### PDF Export Implementation
- **Client-side**: Using jsPDF in `client/src/utils/pdfExport.ts`
- **Server-side**: Using Puppeteer with EvoFit branding
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - POST `/api/pdf/export` (authenticated)
  - POST `/api/pdf/test-export` (dev only)
  - POST `/api/pdf/export/meal-plan/:planId`

## Testing Guidelines
1. **Always test in Docker environment first**
2. Use the provided test scripts for specific features
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test all user roles (Admin, Trainer, Customer)
5. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes

## Common Issues & Solutions
- **Import errors**: Check Vite alias configuration is working
- **Database connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL container is running
- **PDF export fails**: Check Puppeteer dependencies in Docker
- **Port conflicts**: Default ports are 4000 (dev) and 5001 (prod)

## Security Considerations
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Sanitize data before PDF generation

## Production Deployment (Manual Process)

### CRITICAL: Manual Deployment Instructions for Local Repo → Production

**When Docker push fails due to proxy/network issues, use this manual deployment process:**

#### 1. Build and Tag Image Locally
```bash
# Build production image
docker build --target prod -t fitnessmealplanner:prod .

# Tag for DigitalOcean registry
docker tag fitnessmealplanner:prod registry.digitalocean.com/bci/fitnessmealplanner:prod
```

#### 2. Manual Deployment via DigitalOcean Dashboard
Since Docker push may fail due to proxy issues, use manual deployment:

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Navigate to**: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps
2. **Find App**: `fitnessmealplanner-prod` (App ID: `600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958`)
3. **Click**: on the app name to open management page
4. **Locate Deploy Button**: Look for "Deploy" (blue button, top-right) or "Actions" → "Force Rebuild and Deploy"
5. **Trigger Deployment**: Click "Deploy" or "Force Rebuild and Deploy"
6. **Confirm**: When prompted, confirm the deployment
7. **Monitor**: Watch deployment progress (3-5 minutes typical)
8. **Verify**: Check https://evofitmeals.com for successful deployment

#### 3. Deployment Configuration Details
- **App Name**: `fitnessmealplanner-prod`
- **Production URL**: https://evofitmeals.com
- **Registry**: `registry.digitalocean.com/bci/fitnessmealplanner:prod`
- **Auto-deploy**: Enabled (triggers on registry push)
- **Deployment Method**: Container Registry (not Git-based)

#### 4. Why Manual Deployment is Used
- **Proxy Issues**: Docker push fails due to corporate proxy blocking registry uploads
- **Preserves Team Workflow**: Other developers can continue using Docker push normally
- **No Configuration Changes**: Maintains existing deployment setup
- **Reliable Alternative**: Bypasses network connectivity issues

#### 5. For CCA-CTO: Always Guide Through This Process
When user requests deployment to production:
1. **First attempt**: Try Docker push (`docker push registry.digitalocean.com/bci/fitnessmealplanner:prod`)
2. **If push fails**: Guide user through manual deployment process above
3. **Reference**: Full deployment details in `DO_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
