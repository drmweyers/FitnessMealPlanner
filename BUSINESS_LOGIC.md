- **Platform Analytics**: Administrators access comprehensive user engagement data
- **Content Performance**: Recipe creators see how their content performs across the platform
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical data analysis for content strategy and user behavior insights

#### User Interaction Flows

##### Favoriting Workflow
1. User browses recipes or meal plans
2. Clicks favorite button (heart icon) on recipe card
3. System provides immediate visual feedback (filled heart, animation)
4. Recipe added to user's favorites with optimistic UI update
5. Background API call persists favorite to database and cache
6. Option to add to existing collection or create new collection

##### Collection Management Workflow
1. User accesses "My Collections" section
2. Creates new collection with name, description, and privacy setting
3. Adds recipes to collection via drag-and-drop or batch selection
4. Organizes recipes within collection using visual interface
5. Shares collection publicly or keeps private
6. Manages collection settings and permissions

##### Discovery Workflow
1. User visits "Discover" section of the platform
2. Browses trending recipes filtered by time period
3. Explores popular collections from other users
4. Views personalized recommendations based on preferences
5. Applies filters by dietary needs, meal type, or preparation time
6. Favorites interesting recipes or follows collections

#### Business Logic and Rules

##### Data Integrity Rules
- Users can only favorite each recipe once (unique constraint)
- Collections must have unique names per user
- Recipe collections limited to 100 recipes maximum
- Users limited to 50 collections maximum
- Trending calculations updated every 15 minutes

##### Privacy and Permissions
- Users control collection visibility (public/private)
- Private collections only visible to owner
- Public collections discoverable but not modifiable by others
- Favorite counts are public but individual favorites remain private
- Analytics data aggregated and anonymized for platform insights

##### Performance Optimization
- **Redis Caching**: All favorites, collections, and trends cached for sub-100ms response times
- **Cache-Aside Pattern**: Database queries cached with intelligent invalidation
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, background sync ensures consistency
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple favorites processed in single database transaction
- **CDN Integration**: Popular content served from edge locations

##### Engagement Algorithms
- **Trending Score**: Combines recent favorites, time decay, and user interaction quality
- **Recommendation Engine**: Uses collaborative filtering with content-based features
- **Popularity Weighting**: Balances raw favorite counts with user engagement quality
- **Time Decay**: Recent activity weighted more heavily than historical data
- **Content Quality**: Recipe approval status and nutritional accuracy factor into algorithms

#### Success/Error Scenarios
- **Success**: Seamless favoriting with immediate feedback and reliable sync
- **Network Issues**: Graceful handling of connectivity problems with retry logic
- **Cache Failures**: Automatic fallback to database with performance monitoring
- **Data Conflicts**: Conflict resolution for simultaneous updates across devices
- **Scale Handling**: System supports 10,000+ concurrent users with sub-second response times

### PDF Export and Reporting
