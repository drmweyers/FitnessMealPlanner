## Real-Time Recipe Generation Progress

### Overview
The Recipe Generation Progress system provides real-time feedback during bulk recipe generation, allowing administrators to monitor the process without manual refreshes.

### Key Features
- **Live Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates on recipe generation status
- **Step-by-step Monitoring**: Visual feedback for each generation phase
- **Error Reporting**: Immediate notification of any generation failures
- **Completion Metrics**: Detailed statistics upon completion

### How to Use

#### Starting Recipe Generation with Progress Tracking
1. **Navigate** to Admin Panel â†’ Recipes tab
2. **Click** "Generate Recipes" button
3. **Configure** generation parameters:
   - Number of recipes (1-500)
   - Meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)
   - Dietary restrictions
   - Nutritional parameters
   - Natural language prompts
4. **Click** "Start Generation"
5. **Monitor** progress in real-time

#### Progress Display Components
```typescript
// Progress phases shown to users
const phases = {
  starting: 'Initializing generation process...',
  generating: 'Creating recipes with AI...',
  validating: 'Validating recipe data...',
  images: 'Generating recipe images...',
  storing: 'Saving recipes to database...',
  complete: 'Generation completed successfully!',
  failed: 'Generation failed - check error details'
};
```

#### Monitoring Progress
- **Progress Bar**: Visual indicator showing percentage completion
- **Current Step**: Displays which phase is currently executing
- **Recipe Count**: Shows completed vs. total recipes
- **Time Estimates**: Provides estimated completion time
- **Error Logs**: Real-time error reporting if issues occur

### Technical Implementation
The progress system uses:
- **WebSocket-like Polling**: Regular API calls for status updates
- **Job Management**: Background job tracking with unique job IDs
- **Progress Tracker Service**: Server-side service managing generation state
- **React Query**: Optimized data fetching with automatic retries

### API Endpoints
```bash
# Start tracked generation
POST /api/admin/generate
{
  "count": 50,
  "mealTypes": ["breakfast", "lunch"],
  "jobId": "generated-job-id"
}

# Check progress
GET /api/admin/progress/{jobId}
Response: {
  "jobId": "job-123",
  "totalRecipes": 50,
  "completed": 25,
  "failed": 2,
  "currentStep": "generating",
  "percentage": 50,
  "errors": ["Error details..."]
}
```
