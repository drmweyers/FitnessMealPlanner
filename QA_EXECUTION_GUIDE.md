## 🔧 Prerequisites

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure Docker is running
docker ps

# Start development environment
docker-compose --profile dev up -d

# Verify application is accessible
curl http://localhost:4000
```

### 2. Dependencies Check
```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Verify required packages
npm list pg node-fetch @playwright/test
```

### 3. Test Accounts Verification
Ensure the following test accounts exist in the database:
- **Admin:** admin@evofitmeals.com / Admin123!
- **Trainer:** trainer@evofitmeals.com / Trainer123!
- **Customer:** customer@evofitmeals.com / Customer123!

## 🚀 Quick Start - Full QA Suite

### Run Complete Test Suite
```bash
# Execute all tests and generate comprehensive report
npm run qa:full-suite
```

This command will:
1. Check prerequisites
2. Run database integrity tests
3. Execute API endpoint tests
4. Run unit tests
5. Execute E2E tests
6. Generate comprehensive report

**Expected Duration:** 5-10 minutes  
**Output:** `./test-results/COMPREHENSIVE_QA_REPORT.md`

---

## 🧪 Individual Test Suites

### 1. API Testing
```bash
# Test all API endpoints with authentication
npm run qa:api

# Results location
./test-results/api-comprehensive-results.json
./test-results/api-summary.txt
```

**Coverage:**
- Authentication endpoints
- Recipe CRUD operations
- Meal plan generation
- User management
- PDF export APIs
- Progress tracking
- Customer invitations
- Role-based access control

### 2. Database Integrity Testing
```bash
# Test database schema, constraints, and performance
npm run qa:database

# Results location
./test-results/database-integrity-results.json
./test-results/database-summary.txt
```

**Coverage:**
- Schema validation
- Constraint verification
- Relationship integrity
- Data validation
- Performance benchmarks
- Index verification

### 3. End-to-End Testing
```bash
# Test complete user journeys
npm run qa:e2e

# Results location
./test-results.json (Playwright)
./test-screenshots/qa-comprehensive/
```

**Coverage:**
- Authentication flows
- Recipe management
- Meal plan generation
- Customer management
- Progress tracking
- PDF export
- Mobile responsiveness
- Health Protocol removal

### 4. Unit Testing
```bash
# Run existing unit test suite
npm test

# Results location
Terminal output + coverage reports
```

**Coverage:**
- Component testing
- Service layer testing
- Authentication logic
- Data transformation utilities
- Error handling

## 📊 Understanding Test Results

### Pass/Fail Criteria

#### ✅ Production Ready (All Must Pass):
- API endpoints: 100% critical endpoints functional
- Database: 100% integrity tests passing
- Authentication: All role-based access working
- Core features: Recipe management, meal plans, PDF export operational

#### ⚠️ Review Required:
- Performance tests: Response times within acceptable limits
- Mobile responsiveness: All viewports functioning
- Edge cases: Graceful error handling

#### ❌ Deployment Blocked:
- Any authentication failures
- Database integrity issues
- Core feature breakdowns
- Security vulnerabilities

### Test Reports Structure
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Docker Not Running
```bash
# Start Docker and containers
docker-compose --profile dev up -d

# Check container status
docker ps
```

#### Application Not Accessible
```bash
# Check logs
docker logs fitnessmealplanner-dev -f

# Restart if needed
docker-compose --profile dev restart
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify database container
docker ps | grep postgres

# Check database logs
docker logs fitnessmealplanner-postgres-1
```

#### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Install missing packages
npm install pg node-fetch

# For Playwright
npx playwright install
```

### Test Failures

#### API Test Failures
1. Check application logs
2. Verify test account credentials
3. Confirm API endpoints are accessible
4. Review authentication token generation

#### Database Test Failures
1. Verify database connection
2. Check schema migrations
3. Ensure test data exists
4. Review database logs

#### E2E Test Failures
1. Check browser installation: `npx playwright install`
2. Verify application GUI loads
3. Review test screenshots in `./test-screenshots/`
4. Check for timing issues
