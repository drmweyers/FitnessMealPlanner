### LinkedIn Post 1
"I just calculated how much I've spent on meal planning software subscriptions over the last 5 years.

$779.

That's almost **4× more** than what EvoFitMeals costs ($199-$399 ONE-TIME).

Why am I still paying monthly for tools I use every day?

Switching to EvoFitMeals was the easiest business decision I've made this year.

Pay once. Own it forever. No renewal anxiety.

Who else is tired of subscription fatigue? 💬"

### Twitter/X Thread
"1/ Hot take: Subscription models are killing small fitness businesses.

2/ The average fitness trainer pays for 15+ software subscriptions. That's $200-300/month before you even train a client.

3/ EvoFitMeals breaks the cycle:
- $199-$399 ONE-TIME
- Lifetime access
- No monthly bills

4/ In 5 years:
- Subscriptions: $779-$1,558 spent
- EvoFitMeals: $199-$399 spent
- Savings: $380-$1,159

5/ It's not just about money. It's about ownership. Your tools should work FOR you, not hold you hostage.

6/ We built EvoFitMeals because we're trainers too. We hate subscriptions. So we made something better.

7/ Pay once. Plan forever. Try it: [link]"
