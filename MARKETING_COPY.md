## 💬 Customer Support Scripts

### Objection Handling

**"It's too expensive"**
"I understand. Let me ask - how many hours do you spend on meal planning each week? At 20 hours, that's $1,000 of your time at $50/hour. EvoFitMeals is a one-time payment of $199-$399 and gives you those 20 hours back every single week. It pays for itself in less than one week."

**"I like creating plans manually"**
"That's great! Many of our users felt the same way. They now use EvoFitMeals to handle the repetitive parts—generating recipes and calculating macros—while they focus on the personalization and coaching that only they can provide."

**"My clients won't like AI-generated meals"**
"Your clients won't even know they're AI-generated—they'll just know they're getting more variety than ever before. Plus, you can customize everything before sending."
