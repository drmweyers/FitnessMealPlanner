### Dependencies Added
- `json-rules-engine`: Rule-based decision making
- `node-cron`: Scheduled workflow execution
- `events`: Event-driven architecture

## 📝 Integration Requirements

### 1. **Database Metrics Collection**
Need to implement actual database queries for:
- User counts and activity metrics
- Revenue calculations (MRR, ARR)
- Engagement metrics
- Feature usage tracking

### 2. **API Endpoints Required**
```typescript
// New endpoints needed
POST /api/bmad/metrics         // Update business metrics
GET  /api/bmad/recommendations // Get strategic recommendations
GET  /api/bmad/dashboard       // Dashboard data
POST /api/bmad/workflow/:id    // Trigger workflow
GET  /api/bmad/customer/:id    // Customer intelligence
```

### 3. **Environment Variables**
```env
# BMAD Configuration
BMAD_ENABLED=true
BMAD_REDIS_HOST=localhost
BMAD_REDIS_PORT=6379
BMAD_MONITORING_INTERVAL=60000
BMAD_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
```

## 🚦 Next Steps for Integration
