const customersFromAssignments = await db.select({
  customerId: mealPlanAssignments.customerId,
  customerEmail: users.email,
  assignedAt: mealPlanAssignments.assignedAt,
})
.from(mealPlanAssignments)
.innerJoin(users, eq(users.id, mealPlanAssignments.customerId))
.where(eq(mealPlanAssignments.assignedBy, trainerId));
```
