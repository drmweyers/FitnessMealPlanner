## 🔍 @analyst - Business Scenario Analysis

### Current Coverage Assessment

**What We're Testing:**
1. ✅ Happy path workflows (all roles working perfectly)
2. ✅ Basic role collaboration (recipe flow, meal plans, invitations)
3. ✅ Single-user scenarios (one trainer, one customer at a time)
4. ✅ Read operations (viewing data across roles)

**What We're NOT Testing (Gaps):**

### 1. Error Handling & Edge Cases ⚠️ **CRITICAL GAP**

**Missing Test Scenarios:**
- ❌ **Network Failures**: What happens when API calls fail mid-workflow?
  - Trainer creating meal plan → Network drops → Retry behavior
  - Customer viewing plan → Connection lost → Data recovery
  - Admin uploading recipes → S3 upload fails → Rollback/retry

- ❌ **Invalid Data Handling**: How does system respond to bad inputs?
  - Trainer assigns meal plan to non-existent customer
  - Customer deletes meal plan while trainer is editing
  - Admin uploads corrupted recipe image

- ❌ **Permission Denials**: Edge cases in authorization
  - Customer tries to access another customer's meal plan
  - Trainer tries to view customers not assigned to them
  - Expired authentication tokens during long sessions

### 2. Concurrent User Workflows ⚠️ **HIGH-PRIORITY GAP**

**Missing Test Scenarios:**
- ❌ **Multiple Trainers**: What if 2+ trainers work simultaneously?
  - Two trainers assigning same customer different meal plans
  - Race condition: Both trainers editing same meal plan
  - Trainer A deletes recipe while Trainer B adds it to meal plan

- ❌ **Multiple Customers**: Concurrent customer actions
  - 10 customers viewing meal plans simultaneously
  - Multiple customers updating progress at same time
  - Load testing: 100+ customers accessing system concurrently

- ❌ **Admin + Trainer Conflicts**: Simultaneous admin/trainer actions
  - Admin deletes recipe while trainer uses it in meal plan
  - Admin disables trainer account during active meal plan creation
  - Admin changes recipe while trainer is assigning it

### 3. Data Consistency & Integrity ⚠️ **CRITICAL GAP**

**Missing Test Scenarios:**
- ❌ **Cascading Deletes**: What happens when dependencies are removed?
  - Admin deletes recipe → Does it disappear from existing meal plans?
  - Trainer deletes meal plan → Customer data cleanup
  - Trainer account deleted → Customer reassignment workflow

- ❌ **Orphaned Data**: Ensuring referential integrity
  - Customer with meal plan but trainer account disabled
  - Meal plan references deleted recipes
  - Progress tracking for non-existent meal plan

- ❌ **Transaction Boundaries**: Multi-step operations
  - Meal plan creation partially succeeds (recipe added, notification fails)
  - Customer invitation sent but database record creation fails
  - Recipe upload succeeds but S3 storage fails

### 4. Mobile & Responsive Testing ⚠️ **HIGH-PRIORITY GAP**

**Missing Test Scenarios:**
- ❌ **Mobile Device Testing**: Real mobile browsers
  - iPhone Safari: Login, meal plan viewing, progress tracking
  - Android Chrome: Complete trainer workflow on mobile
  - iPad: Admin dashboard on tablet

- ❌ **Touch Interactions**: Mobile-specific gestures
  - Swipe to navigate meal plan days
  - Pinch-to-zoom on recipe images
  - Touch-based form filling

- ❌ **Responsive Breakpoints**: Screen size transitions
  - 375px (mobile): All role workflows functional
  - 768px (tablet): Layout remains usable
  - Desktop → Mobile: Responsive behavior during resize

### 5. Accessibility (a11y) ⚠️ **COMPLIANCE GAP**

**Missing Test Scenarios:**
- ❌ **WCAG 2.1 Compliance**: Legal requirement for accessibility
  - Keyboard navigation: Tab through all role workflows
  - Screen reader testing: NVDA/JAWS compatibility
  - Color contrast: All text meets AA standards
  - Focus indicators: Visible focus states on all interactive elements

- ❌ **Assistive Technology**: Real-world accessibility
  - Screen reader announces role-specific actions correctly
  - Alt text on all recipe images
  - Form labels properly associated
  - Error messages readable by assistive tech

### 6. Performance & Stress Testing ⚠️ **HIGH-PRIORITY GAP**

**Missing Test Scenarios:**
- ❌ **Load Testing**: System under heavy use
  - 100 concurrent trainer logins
  - 500 customers viewing meal plans simultaneously
  - 1000 API requests per second

- ❌ **Large Data Sets**: Performance with real-world data volume
  - Trainer with 500 customers
  - Customer with 100 meal plans (historical data)
  - Admin recipe library with 10,000 recipes

- ❌ **Long-Running Sessions**: Hours-long usage
  - Trainer works for 8 hours → Token expiration handling
  - Customer leaves meal plan open for days → Stale data
  - Admin bulk uploads 1000 recipes → Progress tracking

### 7. Complex Permission Scenarios ⚠️ **MEDIUM-PRIORITY GAP**

**Missing Test Scenarios:**
- ❌ **Role Transitions**: Users changing roles
  - Trainer account upgraded to Admin
  - Customer becomes Trainer → Access to old meal plans
  - Admin temporarily acting as Trainer

- ❌ **Multi-Role Users**: Users with multiple roles
  - User is both Trainer and Customer
  - Trainer managing own meal plan as customer
  - Permission overlap scenarios

- ❌ **Time-Based Permissions**: Subscription/access expiration
  - Customer subscription expires → Meal plan access revoked
  - Trainer trial period ends → Feature restrictions
  - Admin temporary access delegation

### 8. Advanced Workflow Scenarios ⚠️ **BUSINESS-CRITICAL GAP**

**Missing Test Scenarios:**
- ❌ **Meal Plan Modifications**: Complex update workflows
  - Trainer updates assigned meal plan → Customer notification
  - Customer requests changes → Trainer approval workflow
  - Bulk meal plan updates (trainer changes 10 customer plans)

- ❌ **Recipe Versioning**: Recipe changes over time
  - Admin updates recipe → Existing meal plans affected?
  - Recipe history tracking
  - Trainer uses old version vs. new version

- ❌ **Progress Tracking Workflows**: Complete progress journey
  - Customer uploads 100 progress photos → Gallery management
  - Trainer reviews progress → Adjusts meal plan → Customer sees changes
  - Long-term progress tracking (6 months of data)

### 9. API Rate Limiting & Throttling ⚠️ **SECURITY GAP**

**Missing Test Scenarios:**
- ❌ **Rate Limit Enforcement**: Prevent abuse
  - Customer makes 1000 API calls in 1 minute → Throttled
  - Trainer bulk operations trigger rate limit
  - Admin bulk recipe upload respects rate limits

- ❌ **DDoS Protection**: Security testing
  - Malicious customer floods API with requests
  - Bot detection and prevention
  - Graceful degradation under attack

### 10. Integration & Third-Party Services ⚠️ **CRITICAL GAP**

**Missing Test Scenarios:**
- ❌ **S3/DigitalOcean Spaces**: Cloud storage failures
  - S3 temporarily unavailable → Fallback behavior
  - Image upload fails → Retry logic
  - S3 credentials expired → Graceful error handling

- ❌ **OpenAI API**: AI service integration
  - OpenAI rate limit reached → User feedback
  - OpenAI returns malformed data → Validation
  - OpenAI completely down → System degradation

- ❌ **Email Service**: Notification system
  - Email service fails → Invitation workflow
  - Customer email bounces → Admin notification
  - Bulk email sending limits

### Quality Gate Recommendation

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **CONCERNS**

**Reasoning:**
- ✅ Happy path workflows working perfectly
- ⚠️ Critical gaps in error handling (production risk)
- ⚠️ Zero performance/load testing (scalability unknown)
- ⚠️ Zero accessibility testing (compliance risk)
- ⚠️ Minimal concurrent user testing (data integrity risk)

**QA Gate Decision:** **PASS with CONCERNS**
- **PASS**: Core role interactions validated
- **CONCERNS**: Critical gaps identified (see priority list)

**Recommendation:**
1. **Before Production**: Fix P0 issues (error handling, concurrent users, rate limiting)
2. **Before Public Launch**: Fix P1 issues (mobile, accessibility, performance)
3. **Post-Launch**: Address P2 issues (advanced permissions)

**Test:** Network failure during meal plan assignment
**Steps:**
1. Trainer creates meal plan for customer
2. Network disconnects mid-assignment
3. Network reconnects
4. System should retry or show clear error
5. Customer should not receive partial/corrupted meal plan

**Expected Outcome:** Graceful error handling with user feedback

#### Scenario 2: Concurrent Trainer Actions
**Test:** Two trainers edit same customer's meal plan simultaneously
**Steps:**
1. Trainer A opens customer meal plan
2. Trainer B opens same customer meal plan
3. Trainer A makes changes and saves
4. Trainer B makes different changes and saves
