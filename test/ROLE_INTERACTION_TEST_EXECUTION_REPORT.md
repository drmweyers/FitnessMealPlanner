## ⚠️ Issues & Recommendations

### Non-Critical Issues

#### 1. Firefox Network Timeout
- **Test**: Complete Progress Workflow
- **Error**: NS_ERROR_NET_RESET
- **Impact**: Low
- **Recommendation**: Monitor for recurring Firefox issues, consider retry logic

#### 2. WebKit Performance
- **Test**: All tests slower on WebKit
- **Impact**: Low (tests still pass when given more time)
- **Recommendation**: Increase timeout for WebKit-specific runs if needed

#### 3. User Management UI
- **Observation**: Admin user management interface not found at standard paths
- **Impact**: Low (feature may not have dedicated UI yet)
- **Recommendation**: Verify if user management UI exists, update test paths if needed

### Recommendations

**Immediate**:
- ✅ APPROVE for production deployment
- ✅ Run Chromium tests as primary validation
- ✅ Use Firefox/WebKit tests as supplementary validation

**Short-Term**:
- Add retry logic for network-related timeouts
- Increase WebKit timeout thresholds
- Verify admin user management UI paths

**Long-Term**:
- Add visual regression testing
- Implement performance benchmarking
- Add accessibility testing to role interactions
