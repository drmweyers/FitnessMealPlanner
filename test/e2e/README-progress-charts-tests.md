```

## Key Features Tested

### Chart Functionality
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts integration with proper data rendering
- **Time Range Filtering**: 7 days, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, All time
- **Unit Conversion**: lbs ↔ kg switching for weight measurements
- **Trend Analysis**: Up/down/stable trend indicators with percentage changes
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Hover displays with measurement values and dates
- **Quick Statistics**: Current, highest, lowest, and average value displays

### Measurement Configuration
- **Measurement Types**: Waist, Chest, Hips, Neck, Shoulders, Biceps, Thighs, Calves, Body Fat, Muscle Mass
- **Toggle Functionality**: Enable/disable measurement display
- **Legend Updates**: Dynamic legend reflecting enabled measurements
- **Multi-line Charts**: Multiple measurement trends on single chart

### Modal Functionality
- **Form Fields**: Date, weight, body fat, 11 body measurements, notes
- **Validation**: Required date field, number input validation
- **Data Persistence**: Form state maintained during interaction
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
- **Mobile Optimization**: Properly centered and scrollable on mobile devices

### Error Handling
- **Loading States**: Spinner display during data fetch
- **Error States**: Graceful handling of API failures
- **No Data States**: Appropriate messaging when no measurements available
- **Console Error Monitoring**: No JavaScript errors during interactions

## Test Best Practices Applied

### Playwright Best Practices
- **Explicit Waits**: `waitForSelector`, `waitForTimeout` for dynamic content
- **Proper Assertions**: `expect().toBeVisible()`, `expect().toHaveClass()`
- **Error Handling**: Console error monitoring and validation
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Tests run on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Mobile Testing**: Responsive design validation on mobile viewports

### Test Structure
- **BeforeEach Setup**: Consistent login and navigation for each test
- **Isolated Tests**: Each test is independent and can run alone
- **Descriptive Names**: Clear test names describing expected behavior
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Happy path, edge cases, error scenarios
- **Performance Considerations**: Reasonable timeouts and wait strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Chart not loading**: Ensure development server is running and seeded data exists
2. **Modal not opening**: Check for JavaScript errors in console
3. **Time range filters not working**: Verify chart data refresh after filter changes
4. **Mobile viewport issues**: Ensure tests use proper viewport settings

### Debug Tips
- Use `--headed` flag to watch tests run in browser
- Add `await page.pause()` to stop test execution for debugging
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify test data exists in development database

## Coverage Summary
- **Total Test Scenarios**: 31 comprehensive E2E tests
- **Chart Components**: Weight Progress + Body Measurement charts
- **Modal Components**: Add Measurement form with full validation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop viewport testing
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Error Handling**: Loading, error, and no-data state validation

## Integration with CI/CD
These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines and provide comprehensive validation of the Progress tracking functionality before deployment to production.
