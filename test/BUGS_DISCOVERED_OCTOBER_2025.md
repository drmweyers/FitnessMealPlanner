## üö® CRITICAL BUGS (P0 - Security Issues)

### Bug #1: Expired Token Does NOT Redirect to Login ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SECURITY**

**Severity:** P0 - Critical Security Issue
**Status:** üî¥ OPEN
**Discovered By:** Error Handling Test #2

**Description:**
When a user's authentication token expires or is cleared, the application does NOT redirect them to the login page. This allows users to remain on protected routes without valid authentication.

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Login as any role (trainer, customer, admin)
2. Navigate to protected route
3. Clear authentication cookies (simulating expired token)
4. Attempt to access protected route (`/trainer/customers`)
5. **Expected:** Redirect to `/login`
6. **Actual:** Remains on trainer page without authentication

**Test Output:**
```
üìù Step 1: Clear authentication cookies to simulate expired token
üìù Step 2: Try to access protected route
üìù Step 3: Should redirect to login
‚ö†Ô∏è Should redirect to login when token is invalid
‚ùå FAIL - User not redirected to login
```

**Security Impact:**
- **High Risk:** Users with expired tokens can access protected routes
- **Session Hijacking Risk:** Stolen/expired tokens may still work
- **Compliance Issue:** Violates security best practices

**Recommendation:**
- Implement server-side token validation on ALL protected routes
- Add client-side token expiration check with automatic redirect
- Return 401 Unauthorized for expired tokens
- Implement token refresh mechanism

**Files to Fix:**
- `server/middleware/auth.ts` - Add token expiration validation
- `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Add client-side token validation
- `client/src/Router.tsx` - Add auth redirect logic

### Bug #2: Customer CAN Access Trainer Endpoints ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SECURITY**

**Severity:** P0 - Critical Security Issue
**Status:** üî¥ OPEN
**Discovered By:** Error Handling Test #3

**Description:**
Customers can successfully access trainer-only endpoints (`/trainer/customers`), bypassing role-based access control. This is a CRITICAL security vulnerability that allows privilege escalation.

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Login as Customer (`customer.test@evofitmeals.com`)
2. Navigate to `/trainer/customers` (trainer-only route)
3. **Expected:** 403 Forbidden or redirect to customer dashboard
4. **Actual:** Customer can access trainer page

**Test Output:**
```
üìù Step 1: Customer attempts to access trainer-only page
üìù Step 2: Should be blocked or redirected
‚ö†Ô∏è Customer should not access trainer endpoints
‚ùå FAIL - Permission denied not enforced
```

**Security Impact:**
- **Critical Risk:** Customers can view/modify trainer data
- **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information
- **Privilege Escalation:** Role boundaries completely bypassed
- **Compliance Violation:** HIPAA/GDPR data access controls violated

**Recommendation:**
- **IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED** - Production deployment BLOCKED
- Implement proper role-based access control middleware
- Add route-level permission checks on server-side
- Add role validation on ALL protected routes
- Implement defense-in-depth: client-side + server-side checks

**Files to Fix:**
- `server/middleware/auth.ts` - Add role-based authorization middleware
- `server/routes/trainerRoutes.ts` - Add role check to ALL routes
- `client/src/Router.tsx` - Add client-side role validation
- `client/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Enforce role-based routing

**URGENT:** This bug MUST be fixed before any production deployment.

### Bug #3: Network Failure Crashes Page Reload ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**

**Severity:** P1 - High Priority (User Experience Issue)
**Status:** üî¥ OPEN
**Discovered By:** Error Handling Test #1

**Description:**
When network connection is lost (offline mode), attempting to reload the page results in a browser error instead of graceful degradation with user-friendly error message.

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Login as Customer
2. Navigate to `/customer/meal-plans`
3. Enable offline mode (disconnect network)
4. Attempt to reload page
5. **Expected:** Show "You're offline" message with cached data
6. **Actual:** Browser error: `net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED`

**Test Output:**
```
üìù Step 1: Customer views meal plans normally
üìù Step 2: Simulate network failure
üìù Step 3: Try to refresh data
‚ùå Error: page.reload: net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED
```

**User Impact:**
- Poor user experience when network fails
- No offline functionality (data not cached)
- Users lose unsaved work
- Confusing browser error messages

**Recommendation:**
- Implement Service Worker for offline support
- Cache critical data in localStorage/IndexedDB
- Show user-friendly "Offline" banner
- Allow viewing cached meal plans when offline
- Auto-retry when connection restored

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- Create `client/public/service-worker.js`
- Add offline detection in `client/src/hooks/useOnlineStatus.ts`
- Add offline banner component
- Implement data caching strategy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR ISSUES (P2)

### Issue #4: Concurrent Session Test Assertion Error

**Severity:** P2 - Test Issue (Not Production Bug)
**Status:** üü° TEST FIX NEEDED
**Discovered By:** Concurrent User Test #7

**Description:**
Test expects different URLs for two concurrent sessions of same role, but both correctly navigate to same URL. This is correct application behavior, but incorrect test assertion.

**Test Output:**
```
Expected: not "http://localhost:4000/trainer/customers"
Received: "http://localhost:4000/trainer/customers"
```

**Impact:**
- No production bug
- Test needs refinement
- False positive failure

**Recommendation:**
- Fix test assertion to verify session isolation without URL check
- Verify cookie/token differences instead
- Update test to check localStorage isolation
