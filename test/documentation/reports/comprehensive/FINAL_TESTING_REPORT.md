- Optimized connection pool (3‚Üí10 connections)
- Implemented JWT caching
- Reduced bcrypt rounds in development

**Result:** Authentication now completes in 1-3 seconds (95% improvement)

### 3. Form Validation Stability ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** ShadCN Select components causing 30+ second delays  
**Solution:**
- Implemented React.memo for all components
- Added debouncing for value changes
- Fixed controlled/uncontrolled conflicts
- Optimized re-render cycles

**Result:** Form submissions now < 1 second (97% improvement)

### 4. OAuth Configuration ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Missing OAuth environment variables  
**Solution:**
