## 🚨 Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

### High Priority (Blocking Production Testing):

1. **WebSocket Dependencies**
   - **Issue**: Cannot find module './subprotocol' in ws package
   - **Impact**: 47 unhandled errors preventing unit test execution
   - **Solution**: Reinstall ws dependencies or use alternative testing environment

2. **Database Storage Implementation**  
   - **Issue**: 30+ missing method implementations in storage layer
   - **Impact**: Core database operations not testable
   - **Methods Missing**: getMealPlan, updateMealPlan, deleteMealPlan, getUserMealPlans, etc.
   - **Solution**: Complete storage layer implementation or update tests to match actual implementation

3. **Test Environment Isolation**
   - **Issue**: Test environment not properly isolated from production code
   - **Impact**: Tests importing production modules causing dependency conflicts
   - **Solution**: Create proper test doubles and mocks

### Medium Priority (Quality Improvement):

4. **Playwright E2E Testing**
   - **Issue**: Missing protocolFormatter module preventing browser testing
   - **Impact**: No automated browser testing capability
   - **Solution**: Update Playwright dependencies or use alternative e2e framework

5. **Integration Test Configuration**
   - **Issue**: Database connection and environment variable handling
   - **Impact**: Integration tests cannot run in isolation
   - **Solution**: Create proper test database configuration
