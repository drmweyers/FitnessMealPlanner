## Test Configuration

### Vitest Configuration
The tests use Vitest as the testing framework with the following key configurations:

```typescript
// vitest.config.ts additions for 100% coverage tests
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    coverage: {
      reporter: ['text', 'html', 'lcov'],
      exclude: [
        'test/100-percent-test-suite/README.md',
        '**/*.config.js',
        '**/*.config.ts'
      ],
      thresholds: {
        lines: 100,
        functions: 100,
        branches: 100,
        statements: 100
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Mock Configurations
Each test file includes comprehensive mocking strategies:

```typescript
// Example: Recharts mocking for chart components
vi.mock('recharts', () => ({
  ResponsiveContainer: ({ children }: any) => <div data-testid="responsive-container">{children}</div>,
  LineChart: ({ children, data, ...props }: any) => (
    <div data-testid="line-chart" data-chart-props={JSON.stringify(props)}>
      <div data-testid="chart-data">{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>
      {children}
    </div>
  ),
  // Additional mock implementations...
}));
```
