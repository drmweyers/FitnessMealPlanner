## 🚨 Test Issues and Resolutions

### Issues Identified

1. **Icon Mocking Issues**
   - Some Lucide React icons are not properly mocked
   - Missing icons cause test failures
   - Inconsistent icon mocking across test files

2. **Timeout Issues**
   - Some integration tests exceed default timeout
   - Long-running async operations need extended timeouts
   - Timer management in fake timer tests

3. **Act() Warnings**
   - React state updates not wrapped in act()
   - Component re-renders during tests
   - Async state changes in components

### Recommended Fixes

#### 1. Fix Icon Mocking
```typescript
// Add to setup.ts or individual test files
vi.mock('lucide-react', () => {
  const createIcon = (name: string) => {
    const Icon = React.forwardRef((props: any, ref: any) => 
      React.createElement('svg', { 
        ref, 
        'data-testid': `${name.toLowerCase()}-icon`,
        ...props 
      })
    );
    Icon.displayName = name;
    return Icon;
  };
  
  return {
    // Add all icons used in components
    Dumbbell: createIcon('Dumbbell'),
    Target: createIcon('Target'),
    Wand2: createIcon('Wand2'),
    X: createIcon('X'),
    // ... add more as needed
  };
});
```

#### 2. Fix Timeout Issues
```typescript
// In test files with long-running tests
it('handles complete workflow', async () => {
  // ... test code
}, 15000); // Increase timeout to 15 seconds

// Or configure globally in vitest.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    testTimeout: 15000,
    // ...
  },
});
```

#### 3. Fix Act() Warnings
```typescript
// Wrap async operations in act()
import { act } from '@testing-library/react';

it('handles state changes', async () => {
  await act(async () => {
    await user.click(button);
  });
  
  await act(async () => {
    vi.advanceTimersByTime(1000);
  });
});
```
