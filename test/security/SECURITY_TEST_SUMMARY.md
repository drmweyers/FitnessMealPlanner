## 🔒 Security Metrics & Scoring

### Security Score Calculation
```
Base Score = (Passed Tests / Total Tests) × 100
Final Score = Base Score - Vulnerability Deductions

Deductions:
- Critical Vulnerability: -20 points each
- High Vulnerability: -10 points each
- Medium Vulnerability: -5 points each
```

### Risk Level Assessment
- **🔴 CRITICAL**: Critical vulnerabilities detected
- **🟠 HIGH**: 5+ high-severity vulnerabilities
- **🟡 MEDIUM**: 1+ high or 10+ medium vulnerabilities
- **🟢 LOW**: Minor vulnerabilities only
- **ℹ️ INFO**: No significant security issues
