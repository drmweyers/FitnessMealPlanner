## üöÄ Next Actions

### Immediate Next Steps (Execute in Order):

1. **Start Document Sharding**
   ```
   @po
   *shard-prd
   ```
   - This will create `/docs/prd/` folder with sharded epics and stories
   - PO agent will validate and organize the content

2. **Create First Story**
   ```
   @sm
   *create
   ```
   - SM agent will create the first story file
   - Story starts in "Draft" status
   - May require additional context gathering

3. **Implement Story**
   ```
   @dev
   [Provide story file]
   ```
   - Dev agent implements the story
   - Updates file list with changes
   - Marks story as "Review" when complete

4. **QA Review (Optional)**
   ```
   @qa
   *review-story
   ```
   - Senior dev review with refactoring ability
   - Fixes small issues directly
   - Updates story status

## üìù Important Notes

### About BMAD
- **BMAD Method** = Agile AI-Driven Development (software process)
- **NOT** the Business Model Architecture Design (that's a separate business intelligence system for later)
- Uses AI agents to manage the entire development lifecycle

### Current Context
- This is a **Brownfield project** (enhancing existing codebase)
- Using `brownfield-fullstack.yaml` workflow
- All 9 stories are already defined in the PRD
- Ready to execute systematic development

### Session Handoff
When starting the next session:
1. Ask: "Where are we with the BMAD process?"
2. Answer: "Documentation complete, ready to shard PRD and create stories"
3. Next action: Execute `@po *shard-prd` to begin Phase 2
