## 🚀 Next Actions

### Immediate Next Steps (Execute in Order):

1. **Start Document Sharding**
   ```
   @po
   *shard-prd
   ```
   - This will create `/docs/prd/` folder with sharded epics and stories
   - PO agent will validate and organize the content

2. **Create First Story**
   ```
   @sm
   *create
   ```
   - SM agent will create the first story file
   - Story starts in "Draft" status
   - May require additional context gathering

3. **Implement Story**
   ```
   @dev
   [Provide story file]
   ```
   - Dev agent implements the story
   - Updates file list with changes
   - Marks story as "Review" when complete

4. **QA Review (Optional)**
   ```
   @qa
   *review-story
   ```
   - Senior dev review with refactoring ability
   - Fixes small issues directly
   - Updates story status
