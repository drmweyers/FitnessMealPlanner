## 📊 BMAD Workflow Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Documentation (COMPLETE)

| Task | Status | Location | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Install BMAD Framework | ✅ Complete | `/.bmad-core/` | Agents, workflows, tasks installed |
| Create Brownfield PRD | ✅ Complete | `/docs/prd.md` | 9 comprehensive user stories |
| Document Architecture | ✅ Complete | `/docs/architecture.md` | Technical blueprint for integration |
| Configure Workflow | ✅ Complete | `brownfield-fullstack.yaml` | Workflow ready for execution |

### ⏳ Phase 2: Story Creation (NEXT STEP)

| Task | Status | Command | Notes |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| Shard PRD Document | 🔴 Not Started | `@po *shard-prd` | Creates `/docs/prd/` with sharded stories |
| Create Story Files | 🔴 Not Started | `@sm *create` | Creates individual story.md files |
| Review Draft Stories | 🔴 Not Started | Manual review | Optional but recommended |

### 📋 Phase 3: Development (UPCOMING)

| Story | Title | Status | Agent |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 | Multi-Role Authentication System | 📋 Planned | Dev |
| 1.2 | AI-Powered Recipe Generation | 📋 Planned | Dev |
| 1.3 | Advanced Recipe Search | 📋 Planned | Dev |
| 1.4 | Intelligent Meal Plan Generation | 📋 Planned | Dev |
| 1.5 | Trainer-Customer Management | 📋 Planned | Dev |
| 1.6 | Progress Tracking System | 📋 Planned | Dev |
| 1.7 | PDF Generation and Export | 📋 Planned | Dev |
| 1.8 | Responsive UI/UX | 📋 Planned | Dev |
| 1.9 | System Administration | 📋 Planned | Dev |

## 🚀 Next Actions

### Immediate Next Steps (Execute in Order):

1. **Start Document Sharding**
   ```
   @po
   *shard-prd
   ```
   - This will create `/docs/prd/` folder with sharded epics and stories
   - PO agent will validate and organize the content

2. **Create First Story**
   ```
   @sm
   *create
   ```
   - SM agent will create the first story file
   - Story starts in "Draft" status
   - May require additional context gathering

3. **Implement Story**
   ```
   @dev
   [Provide story file]
   ```
   - Dev agent implements the story
   - Updates file list with changes
   - Marks story as "Review" when complete

4. **QA Review (Optional)**
   ```
   @qa
   *review-story
   ```
   - Senior dev review with refactoring ability
   - Fixes small issues directly
   - Updates story status

## 📁 BMAD Resources

### Documentation
- **PRD**: `/docs/prd.md` - Complete requirements with 9 user stories
- **Architecture**: `/docs/architecture.md` - Technical implementation guide
- **Workflow Status**: This file (`BMAD_WORKFLOW_STATUS.md`)

### BMAD Framework
- **Location**: `/.bmad-core/`
- **Workflow**: `/workflows/brownfield-fullstack.yaml`
- **Agents**: `/agents/` (pm, po, sm, dev, qa, architect, analyst)
- **Tasks**: `/tasks/` (create-story, shard-doc, etc.)

### Key Agents for Current Phase
- **PO (Product Owner)**: Document sharding and validation
- **SM (Scrum Master)**: Story creation and management
- **Dev (Developer)**: Story implementation
- **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Code review and testing

---

## 🔄 Workflow Cycle

```
1. PO shards PRD → Creates /docs/prd/ folder
2. SM creates story → Creates story.md file
3. Dev implements → Updates codebase
4. QA reviews → Validates implementation
5. Repeat for next story → Continue until all 9 stories complete
```

## 📝 Important Notes

### About BMAD
- **BMAD Method** = Agile AI-Driven Development (software process)
- **NOT** the Business Model Architecture Design (that's a separate business intelligence system for later)
- Uses AI agents to manage the entire development lifecycle

### Current Context
- This is a **Brownfield project** (enhancing existing codebase)
- Using `brownfield-fullstack.yaml` workflow
- All 9 stories are already defined in the PRD
- Ready to execute systematic development

### Session Handoff
When starting the next session:
1. Ask: "Where are we with the BMAD process?"
2. Answer: "Documentation complete, ready to shard PRD and create stories"
3. Next action: Execute `@po *shard-prd` to begin Phase 2
