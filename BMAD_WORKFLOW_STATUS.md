- Uses AI agents to manage the entire development lifecycle

### Current Context
- This is a **Brownfield project** (enhancing existing codebase)
- Using `brownfield-fullstack.yaml` workflow
- All 9 stories are already defined in the PRD
- Ready to execute systematic development

### Session Handoff
When starting the next session:
1. Ask: "Where are we with the BMAD process?"
2. Answer: "Documentation complete, ready to shard PRD and create stories"
3. Next action: Execute `@po *shard-prd` to begin Phase 2
