# Session Status - Responsive Design Fix & Production Deployment
**Date**: January 18, 2025
**Session Type**: Mobile Experience Fix & Progressive Web App Restoration
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

## Quick Resume for Next Session

### Critical Issue Resolved
- **Problem**: Desktop users were seeing mobile-optimized layouts
- **Root Cause**: `mobileTouchTargets.ts` JavaScript was forcing mobile styles on screens < 1024px
- **Solution**: Disabled JavaScript override, implemented proper CSS media queries
- **Result**: Progressive Web App now properly responsive on all device sizes

### Key Fixes Applied
- ✅ **Disabled mobileTouchTargets.ts**: Commented out import in `main.tsx`
- ✅ **Rewrote CSS**: Created clean `responsive.css` with proper breakpoints
- ✅ **Fixed Breakpoints**: Mobile (0-767px), Tablet (768-1023px), Desktop (1024px+)
- ✅ **Removed Aggressive Overrides**: Eliminated `!important` flags from CSS
- ✅ **Restored Natural Sizing**: Desktop buttons now 48px (not forced 44px)
