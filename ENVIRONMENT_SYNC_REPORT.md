**Status**: ✅ SYNCHRONIZED

## Executive Summary

Both development and production environments have been successfully synchronized with all recent updates deployed and verified working.

## Synchronization Actions Completed

### 1. Code Updates Deployed

curl -s https://evofitmeals.com/api/health

# Check production logs
doctl apps logs 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 --type=run --tail 50

# Verify deployment status
doctl apps get-deployment 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 [deployment-id]

# Run sync verification
node scripts/verify-sync.cjs

# Check Docker status
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
✅ None required - environments are fully synchronized

### Future Improvements
1. **Automated Deployment Pipeline**: Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
2. **Health Monitoring**: Implement uptime monitoring with alerts
3. **Backup Strategy**: Regular database backups to S3
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add APM tools for tracking response times
5. **Error Tracking**: Integrate Sentry or similar for error reporting

## Conclusion

Both development and production environments are now **100% synchronized** with all recent fixes deployed and verified. The system is stable and all critical features are functioning correctly:

- ✅ PDF export working with proper template resolution
- ✅ Landing pages serving with CDN-hosted images
- ✅ React app loading with correct asset paths
- ✅ All API endpoints responding normally
- ✅ Database and cache services healthy

No further synchronization actions are required at this time.
