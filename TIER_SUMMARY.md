## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What happens if I reach my customer limit?**
A: You'll need to upgrade to the next tier. You can upgrade anytime by paying the price difference. All your data transfers automatically.

**Q: Do meal plans roll over?**
A: Yes! The meal plan limit is cumulative (total you can create over your lifetime). They don't expire or reset.

**Q: Can I get a refund?**
A: 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied. No questions asked.

**Q: Can I downgrade if I have fewer clients?**
A: Downgrades are not available, but you keep lifetime access to your current tier even if you're not using all slots.

### Recipe Database Questions

**Q: What does "Recipe Library Access" mean?**
A: Each tier gives you access to a specific number of recipes in our database. Starter gets 1,000 recipes, Professional gets 2,500, and Enterprise gets 4,000. These are fully customizable recipes you can use to create meal plans for your clients.

**Q: What are "Monthly New Recipes"?**
A: Every month, we add new recipes to your tier's database automatically:
- Starter: +25 recipes/month
- Professional: +50 recipes/month
- Enterprise: +100 recipes/month (priority early access)

Your library keeps growing without any additional cost!

**Q: Do I lose access to recipes if I don't upgrade?**
A: No! Once you purchase a tier, you keep lifetime access to all recipes in that tier, including all monthly additions. Your recipe library only grows, never shrinks.

**Q: What are "Meal Type Varieties"?**
A: These are different categories of meals available in your tier:
- **Starter (5 types):** Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack, Post-Workout
- **Professional (10 types):** All Starter types + Pre-Workout, Keto, Vegan, Paleo, High-Protein
- **Enterprise (15+ types):** All Professional types + Gluten-Free, Low-Carb, Mediterranean, DASH, Intermittent Fasting, Bodybuilding, Endurance

**Q: Can I create my own recipes outside the database?**
A: Yes! All tiers allow you to create custom recipes. The recipe database access is the number of pre-made, professionally curated recipes you can access instantly.

**Q: What are "Seasonal Recipes"?**
A: Seasonal recipes are special collections released quarterly (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) featuring seasonal ingredients and trending meal plans. Professional and Enterprise tiers get automatic access to these collections.

**Q: Do the monthly new recipes increase my tier limit?**
A: No! The monthly new recipes are additions to your accessible recipe database, not your meal plan creation limit. For example, Starter tier can create 50 meal plans (lifetime), but can choose from 1,000+ recipes (growing by 25/month).

## 🎯 Database Schema Considerations

### New Tables Required

**recipe_tier_access:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE recipe_tier_access (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tier tier_level_enum NOT NULL,
  base_recipe_count INTEGER NOT NULL, -- 1000, 2500, 4000
  monthly_addition_count INTEGER NOT NULL, -- 25, 50, 100
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**recipe_type_categories:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE recipe_type_categories (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, -- "Breakfast", "Keto", etc.
  tier_level tier_level_enum NOT NULL, -- Minimum tier required
  is_seasonal BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**trainer_recipe_access_log:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE trainer_recipe_access_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  trainer_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  tier tier_level_enum NOT NULL,
  recipes_available INTEGER NOT NULL,
  month_year VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL, -- "2025-02"
  recipes_added INTEGER NOT NULL, -- 25, 50, or 100
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Usage Tracking Updates

Update `tier_usage_tracking` table to include recipe usage:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tier_usage_tracking
ADD COLUMN recipes_accessed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN last_recipe_access TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN meal_types_used TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}';
```
