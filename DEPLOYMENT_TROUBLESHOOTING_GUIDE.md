# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide
## Comprehensive Problem Resolution for DigitalOcean Container Registry Deployments

**Based on successful Health Protocol removal deployment analysis and common issues**

---

## üéØ Overview

This guide provides detailed troubleshooting procedures for common deployment issues, with specific solutions tested during our production deployments. Each issue includes symptoms, root causes, and step-by-step resolution procedures.

---

## üö® Critical Issue: Docker Push Appears to Timeout But Actually Succeeds

### Symptoms
- `docker push` command appears to hang or timeout
- No clear success/failure message
- Uncertainty about whether registry was updated
- Deployment status unclear

### Root Cause Analysis
**Key Finding**: Registry push can complete successfully even when the Docker CLI doesn't provide clear feedback due to network proxy/firewall configurations.

### Resolution Procedure
```bash
# Step 1: Don't panic - check registry directly
doctl registry repository list-tags fitnessmealplanner

# Step 2: Look for updated timestamp on 'prod' tag
# Example successful output:
# Tag    Compressed Size    Updated At                       Manifest Digest
# prod   4.95 kB           2025-08-20 21:05:14 +0000 UTC    sha256:f0167...

# Step 3: If timestamp is recent (within last 10 minutes), push was successful
# Step 4: Check if auto-deployment was triggered
doctl apps get 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958

# Step 5: Look for "Updated At" timestamp change - indicates deployment triggered
```

### Prevention
- Monitor registry timestamps during push
- Use verbose Docker output: `docker push --verbose`
- Set up registry push notifications if possible

---

## ‚è∞ Deployment Timing and Verification Issues

### Issue: Premature Deployment Verification
**Symptom**: Checking production too quickly after push, before deployment completes

### Resolution Protocol
```bash
# Wait Strategy: 7-10 minute deployment window
echo "Registry push completed at: $(date)"
echo "Waiting 7 minutes for deployment to complete..."

# Monitor deployment progress every 60 seconds
for i in {1..7}; do
  echo "Minute $i: Checking deployment status..."
  doctl apps get 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 | grep "Updated At"
  sleep 60
done

echo "Deployment window complete - safe to verify"
```

### Issue: Deployment Status Confusion  
**Symptom**: Unclear whether deployment is complete or still in progress

### Status Interpretation Guide
```bash
# Command to check deployment status
doctl apps get 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958

# Status Indicators:
# 1. "Updated At" timestamp = Last deployment trigger time
# 2. "Active Deployment ID" = Currently running deployment
# 3. "In Progress Deployment ID" = blank means no active deployment

# Get detailed deployment status
doctl apps get-deployment 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 <deployment-id>
# Look for: Progress: 7/7, Phase: ACTIVE
```

## üèóÔ∏è Docker Build and Registry Issues

### Issue: Docker Build Fails - Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Symptom: Build fails during dependency installation
# Error: Cannot find module 'xyz' or package not found

# Solution 1: Clear Docker cache and rebuild
docker builder prune -a
docker build --target prod --no-cache -t fitnessmealplanner:prod .

# Solution 2: Check package.json vs package-lock.json consistency
npm install  # Regenerate lock file if needed

# Solution 3: Verify Dockerfile COPY commands
# Ensure package.json is copied before npm install
```

### Issue: Registry Authentication Failure
```bash
# Symptom: "unauthorized: authentication required"
# Error during docker push command

# Solution 1: Re-authenticate with DigitalOcean
doctl registry login

# Solution 2: Check token validity
doctl auth list
doctl account get  # Should return account info

# Solution 3: Manual authentication if doctl fails
echo "$DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" | docker login registry.digitalocean.com -u bci --password-stdin

# Solution 4: Verify registry exists
doctl registry get
```

### Issue: Image Build Succeeds But Push Fails
```bash
# Symptom: Local build works, but registry push fails

# Diagnostic commands
docker images | grep fitnessmealplanner  # Verify image exists locally
docker tag fitnessmealplanner:prod registry.digitalocean.com/bci/fitnessmealplanner:prod
docker push registry.digitalocean.com/bci/fitnessmealplanner:prod --verbose

# If push still fails, check network connectivity
curl -I https://registry.digitalocean.com
ping registry.digitalocean.com

# Alternative: Use doctl to create deployment directly
doctl apps create-deployment 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958
```

## üîÑ Auto-Deployment Issues

### Issue: Registry Push Succeeds But Deployment Doesn't Trigger
```bash
# Symptom: Registry shows updated image but app doesn't deploy

# Step 1: Verify auto-deployment is enabled
doctl apps get 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 | grep -i "auto"

# Step 2: Check if deployment is stuck
doctl apps list-deployments 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958

# Step 3: Manual deployment trigger if needed
doctl apps create-deployment 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958

# Step 4: Check deployment logs for errors
doctl apps logs 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 --type build
doctl apps logs 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 --type run
```

### Issue: Deployment Stuck in Progress
```bash
# Symptom: Deployment shows "In Progress" for >15 minutes

# Step 1: Check deployment details
doctl apps get-deployment 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 <deployment-id>

# Step 2: Check for resource constraints
doctl apps logs 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 --type build | tail -50

# Step 3: If truly stuck, cancel and retry
doctl apps cancel-deployment 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958
doctl apps create-deployment 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958
```

# Symptom: Deployment fails during database migration phase

# Step 1: Check migration logs
doctl apps logs 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 --type run | grep -i migration

# Step 2: Verify database connectivity
# Use a database client to connect to production DB
# Connection string from DigitalOcean dashboard

# Step 3: Check if migrations can be run manually
# Connect to database and check migration status

# Step 4: Rollback if migrations are problematic
# Use previous deployment or manual database rollback
```

### Issue: Database Connection Timeouts
```bash
# Symptom: App starts but can't connect to database

# Check database cluster status
doctl databases list
doctl databases get <database-id>

# Check connection pool settings in application
# Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable

# Monitor database connections
doctl databases get-connection-info <database-id>
```

## üìä Troubleshooting Decision Tree

### When Deployment Appears to Fail

1. **Check registry first**: `doctl registry repository list-tags fitnessmealplanner`
   - If updated timestamp is recent ‚Üí Push succeeded, wait for deployment
   - If no recent timestamp ‚Üí Push failed, retry push

2. **Check deployment status**: `doctl apps get 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958`
   - If "Updated At" is recent ‚Üí Deployment triggered
   - If no recent update ‚Üí Auto-deployment failed, manual trigger needed

3. **Wait appropriate time**: 7-10 minutes for full deployment
   - Monitor with `doctl apps get-deployment`
   - Check Progress: X/7 and Phase: status

4. **Verify production**: Test actual functionality
   - HTTP status codes
   - Core features
   - Database connectivity
   - Removed features return 404

5. **If still failing**: Check logs and consider rollback
   - `doctl apps logs` for detailed error information
   - Emergency rollback if critical
