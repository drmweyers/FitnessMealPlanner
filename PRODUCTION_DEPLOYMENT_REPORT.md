## Fixes Deployed

### 1. Race Condition Fix

- **Fix**: Added loading state guard before empty state check

### 2. API Response Parsing

## Deployment Method Notes

### Why Manual Deployment Was Used
- Docker build process timed out during export phase
- Known proxy issues prevent direct registry push
- DigitalOcean CLI provides reliable alternative
- Manual deployment completed successfully in ~2 minutes

### Future Recommendations
1. Continue using manual deployment when Docker push fails
2. Consider optimizing Docker build process
3. Document timeout thresholds for team awareness
