## 🧪 Test Suite 1: Meal Plan Assignment ID Verification

**File:** `test/e2e/meal-plan-assignment-id-verification.spec.ts`
**Purpose:** Validates the fix for customer meal plan assignment ID mismatch issue
**Tests:** 4 tests × 3 browsers = 12 test executions

### Test Coverage

#### Test 1: Manual Meal Plan ID Consistency
**Validates:** Single source of truth - trainer and customer see same plan ID

**Steps:**
1. ✅ Trainer creates manual meal plan → Gets plan ID `X`
2. ✅ Trainer assigns plan to customer
3. ✅ Customer fetches their meal plans
4. ✅ **CRITICAL:** Customer sees plan ID `X` (NOT a different ID)
5. ✅ Plan data integrity verified (same meals, same content)

**Evidence of Fix Working:**
```
Trainer created plan ID: 259eb46d-1b38-4fb7-a31e-ac3e8d8f9325
Customer sees plan ID:   259eb46d-1b38-4fb7-a31e-ac3e8d8f9325
IDs match: true ✅
```

**Before Fix (BROKEN):**
```
Trainer created plan ID: cd86401e-6dae-4352-aa5b-b0a3d7ff9428
Customer sees plan ID:   6e6b17d2-24b3-418b-b677-a4e89247605e ❌
IDs match: false ❌
```

---

#### Test 2: Multiple Plans ID Preservation
**Validates:** Each assignment preserves unique IDs correctly

**Steps:**
1. ✅ Trainer creates 3 separate meal plans
2. ✅ Assigns all 3 to customer
3. ✅ Customer sees all 3 plans with correct IDs
4. ✅ No ID conflicts or duplicates
5. ✅ All IDs are unique

**Results:**
```
Plan 1: 96caad66-f10e-408d-b462-80ec0fda9829 ✅ found
Plan 2: 48ce24b4-ffbc-42e3-b15b-1b7abd46b4e8 ✅ found
Plan 3: 9d51d499-f522-49ab-96cf-f84ab8c53533 ✅ found
All IDs unique: true ✅
```

---

#### Test 3: UI-Based Assignment Verification
**Validates:** Assignment works correctly via UI (not just API)

**Steps:**
1. ✅ Trainer creates plan via API (setup)
2. ✅ Trainer assigns to customer
3. ✅ Customer logs in via UI (Playwright browser)
4. ✅ Customer can see meal plan elements in UI
5. ✅ Customer can access assigned plan via API from UI session

**Browser Coverage:**
- ✅ Chromium (Chrome/Edge)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ WebKit (Safari)

---

#### Test 4: Summary Validation
**Validates:** All tests passed across all browsers

**Key Validations:**
- ✅ Trainer creates plan with ID X
- ✅ Customer sees plan with SAME ID X (not duplicate)
- ✅ No ID mismatches or orphaned duplicates
- ✅ Plan data integrity maintained

---

## 🧪 Test Suite 2: Role Collaboration Workflows

**File:** `test/e2e/role-collaboration-workflows.spec.ts`
**Purpose:** Validates complete role interaction workflows
**Tests:** 9 comprehensive E2E tests

### Test Coverage

| Test | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Test 1 | Recipe Workflow (Admin → Trainer → Customer) | ✅ PASS |
| Test 2 | Admin Trainer Management | ✅ PASS |
| Test 3 | Trainer-Customer Invitation Workflow | ✅ PASS |
| Test 4 | **Meal Plan Assignment Workflow** | ✅ PASS |
| Test 5 | Multi-Plan Management | ✅ PASS |
| Test 6 | Progress Tracking Workflow | ✅ PASS |
| Test 7 | Admin Customer Support | ✅ PASS |
| Test 8 | Complete System Workflow (Full Lifecycle) | ✅ PASS |
| Test 9 | Summary - All workflows validated | ✅ PASS |

**Test 4 specifically validates:**
- ✅ Trainer can create meal plans
- ✅ Trainer can assign to customers
- ✅ Customer can view assigned plans
- ✅ Workflow completes successfully

## 🎯 What These Tests Validate

### Core Business Value
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth:** One meal plan, one ID (trainer_meal_plans table)
- ✅ **ID Consistency:** Trainer and customer always see the same plan ID
- ✅ **No Duplicates:** Assignment creates link (meal_plan_assignments), not duplicate
- ✅ **Data Integrity:** Plan content, meals, and metadata remain consistent

### Technical Validation
- ✅ **API Endpoints:** `/api/trainer/manual-meal-plan`, `/api/trainer/meal-plans/:id/assign`, `/api/meal-plan/personalized`
- ✅ **Database Joins:** meal_plan_assignments ⟶ trainer_meal_plans working correctly
- ✅ **Auth & Permissions:** Trainer can create/assign, customer can view
- ✅ **Cross-Browser:** Chromium, Firefox, WebKit all pass

## 🔍 Test Architecture

### Test Strategy

**Approach:** Hybrid API + UI Testing

1. **API Testing (Fast Setup)**
   - Login via API for authentication
   - Create meal plans via API
   - Verify data via API calls
   - ✅ Faster execution (< 1 second per test)

2. **UI Testing (User Validation)**
   - Playwright browser automation
   - Real user interactions
   - Visual verification
   - ✅ Confirms UI displays data correctly

3. **Cross-Browser (Compatibility)**
   - Chromium (Chrome, Edge)
   - Firefox
   - WebKit (Safari)
   - ✅ Ensures fix works everywhere

## 🎓 How to Extend These Tests

### Add New Test Case

```typescript
// In meal-plan-assignment-id-verification.spec.ts

test('4. New Test: Your test description', async ({ browser }) => {
  console.log('\n🧪 Test 4: Your test name');

  // Step 1: Login
  const { token: trainerToken } = await loginViaAPI('trainer');
  const { token: customerToken, user: customer } = await loginViaAPI('customer');

  // Step 2: Your test logic
  // ... API calls, validations, etc.

  // Step 3: Assertions
  expect(result).toBeTruthy();
  console.log('✅ Test passed');
});
```

### Add New Validation

```typescript
// Verify additional plan metadata
expect(customerPlan.assignedBy).toBe(trainer.id);
expect(customerPlan.trainerEmail).toBe(trainer.email);
expect(customerPlan.notes).toContain('test');
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Tests

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: "Server not running"**
```bash
# Ensure dev server is running
docker ps | grep fitnessmealplanner
# Should show container running on port 4000
```

**Issue 2: "Authentication failed"**
```bash
# Reset test accounts
npm run reset:test-accounts

# Verify credentials in test file match:
# trainer.test@evofitmeals.com / TestTrainer123!
# customer.test@evofitmeals.com / TestCustomer123!
```

**Issue 3: "Plan ID not found"**
```bash
# This would indicate the fix regressed
# Check server logs:
docker logs fitnessmealplanner-dev --tail 50

# Verify mealPlan.ts has correct joins
```
