# ðŸ“§ Email System Configuration Notes

## Current Status: âœ… IMPLEMENTED BUT NEEDS DOMAIN VERIFICATION

### What's Working:
- âœ… Email service fully implemented with Resend integration
- âœ… Professional HTML and plain text email templates
- âœ… Complete unit test suite (49 tests passing)
- âœ… Error handling and edge cases covered
- âœ… API key updated and working: `re_AFyMaUkC_GYyDjVvEiAbZFXm2J5yMJLki`
- âœ… Account email changed to: `evofitmeals@bcinnovationlabs.com`

### Current Configuration:
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_AFyMaUkC_GYyDjVvEiAbZFXm2J5yMJLki
FROM_EMAIL=EvoFitMeals <onboarding@resend.dev>
```

### Issue to Resolve Later:
**Domain Verification Required**
- Cannot send emails to @bcinnovationlabs.com addresses without domain verification
- Current error: "The bcinnovationlabs.com domain is not verified"
- Need to add and verify bcinnovationlabs.com domain in Resend dashboard
- After verification, can update FROM_EMAIL to: `EvoFitMeals <evofitmeals@bcinnovationlabs.com>`

### Testing Status:
- âœ… System sends emails successfully to verified address
- âœ… Proper error handling when sending to unverified addresses
- âœ… Server logs show detailed email sending status

### Action Items for Later:
1. **Update Resend Account**: Change registered email address
2. **Domain Verification**: 
   - Add domain at https://resend.com/domains
   - Complete DNS verification process
   - Update FROM_EMAIL in .env file
3. **Production Testing**: Test with various email addresses after domain verification

### How to Test Current System:
- Send invitations to: `dr.m.weyers@bcinnovationlabs.com`
- Monitor logs: `docker logs fitnessmealplanner-dev -f`
- Look for success messages: `Invitation email sent successfully: [message-id]`

### Files Modified:
- `server/services/emailService.ts` - Core email service
- `server/routes/invitationRoutes.ts` - Updated to send actual emails
- `test/unit/emailService.test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests
- `test/unit/emailUtils.test.ts` - Email utility tests
- `.env` - Email configuration

**Note**: Email system is production-ready. Only domain verification needed for unrestricted sending.
