# Deployment Verification Guide: Health Protocol Removal

## Verification Summary

**✅ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL - Health Protocol Removed from Production**

This document provides step-by-step verification that the Health Protocol feature has been successfully removed from the production environment.

## Quick Verification Commands

### 1. Check Active Deployment
```bash
doctl apps get 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958
```

**Expected Output:**
- Active Deployment ID: `37356058-442f-4c4b-a6e6-cddb23f3dd32`
- Status: Should show latest deployment as active

### 2. Verify Deployment Completion
```bash
doctl apps get-deployment 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 37356058-442f-4c4b-a6e6-cddb23f3dd32
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Progress: 7/7
Phase: ACTIVE
Updated At: 2025-08-20 21:07:23 +0000 UTC
```

### 3. Check Docker Registry
```bash
doctl registry repository list-tags fitnessmealplanner
```

**Expected Output:**
- `prod` tag updated: 2025-08-20 21:05:14 +0000 UTC
- Manifest: `sha256:f0167da6908c287d54395b0985bcb32da2ba6caecc76ce31b15dde1f7029501d`

## Code Verification

### 1. Verify Health Protocol Components Removed
```bash
# Should return no results:
find client -name "*HealthProtocol*" -o -name "*SpecializedProtocol*"

# Should return no matches:
grep -r "TrainerHealthProtocols\|SpecializedProtocolsPanel" client/
```

### 2. Check Database Schema Clean
```bash
# Should return no matches:
grep -r "trainerHealthProtocols\|protocolAssignments" server/
```

### 3. Verify Git State
```bash
# Check latest commit on main:
git log --oneline -1 main
# Expected: 63bd8d2 feat(deploy): Trigger production deployment with Health Protocol removal
```

## Production URL Testing

### Manual Verification Steps

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Use Ctrl+F5 (hard refresh) or open incognito window
   - This ensures you're not seeing cached content

2. **Test Primary URL**
   - Navigate to: https://evofitmeals.com
   - Login as trainer user
   - Verify Health Protocol navigation/tabs are not visible

3. **Test Health Protocol Routes** (Should Return 404)
   - https://evofitmeals.com/trainer/health-protocols
   - Any related protocol routes should not be accessible

4. **Test DigitalOcean URL** (Backup Verification)
   - Navigate to: https://fitnessmealplanner-prod-vt7ek.ondigitalocean.app
   - Should show same behavior as primary URL

## Automated Verification Scripts

### 1. Basic Health Check Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Checking production deployment status..."

# Check active deployment
ACTIVE_DEPLOYMENT=$(doctl apps get 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 --format ID,ActiveDeploymentID --no-header)
echo "Active Deployment: $ACTIVE_DEPLOYMENT"

# Check if it's the correct deployment
if [[ "$ACTIVE_DEPLOYMENT" == *"37356058-442f-4c4b-a6e6-cddb23f3dd32"* ]]; then
    echo "✅ Correct deployment is active"
else
    echo "❌ Unexpected deployment active"
fi
```

### 2. Code Verification Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Verifying Health Protocol removal from codebase..."

# Check for Health Protocol components
HP_COMPONENTS=$(find client -name "*HealthProtocol*" -o -name "*SpecializedProtocol*" | wc -l)
if [ $HP_COMPONENTS -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ No Health Protocol components found"
else
    echo "❌ Found $HP_COMPONENTS Health Protocol components"
fi

# Check for Health Protocol database references
HP_DB=$(grep -r "trainerHealthProtocols\|protocolAssignments" server/ | wc -l)
if [ $HP_DB -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ No Health Protocol database references found"
else
    echo "❌ Found $HP_DB Health Protocol database references"
fi
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If Health Protocol is Still Visible

1. **Check Deployment Status**
   ```bash
   doctl apps get 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958
   ```
   - Ensure Active Deployment ID is `37356058-442f-4c4b-a6e6-cddb23f3dd32`

2. **Clear Browser Cache Aggressively**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
   - Or use incognito/private browsing mode

3. **Wait for CDN Propagation**
   - Allow up to 5-10 minutes for edge cache clearing
   - Try accessing from different network/device

4. **Check Multiple URLs**
   - Test both https://evofitmeals.com and https://fitnessmealplanner-prod-vt7ek.ondigitalocean.app
   - If behavior differs, there may be a DNS/routing issue

### If Deployment Shows as Failed

1. **Check Deployment Logs**
   ```bash
   doctl apps logs 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 --type build
   doctl apps logs 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 --type run
   ```

2. **Trigger Manual Deployment**
   ```bash
   doctl apps create-deployment 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958
   ```
