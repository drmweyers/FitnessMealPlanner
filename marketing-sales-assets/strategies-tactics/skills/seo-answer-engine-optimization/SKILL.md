## Instructions

### Step 1: Longtail Keyword Research

When user requests keyword research:

1. **Identify seed keywords** from product/category
   - Example: "meal planning app" → "meal planning app for trainers"

2. **Use keyword modifiers** to generate longtail variations:
   - **BOF (Bottom of Funnel):** "X vs Y," "X alternative," "X pricing," "X review"
   - **Top of Funnel:** "how to," "what is," "why," "when"
   - **Question-based:** "which," "should I," "can I"

3. **Prioritize by:**
   - Search volume (100+ searches/month)
   - Keyword difficulty (< 30)
   - Commercial intent (high = "best," "review," "vs")

4. **Output format:**
   ```markdown
   ## Longtail Keyword Research: [Category]

   ### High Priority (Volume 500+, Difficulty < 20)
   | Keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Intent | Priority |
   |---------|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
   | best meal planning app for trainers | 720 | 18 | Commercial | HIGH |
   | meal prep software vs spreadsheets | 590 | 12 | Commercial | HIGH |

   ### Medium Priority (Volume 100-500, Difficulty < 30)
   | Keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Intent | Priority |
   |---------|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
   | how to create meal plans for clients | 340 | 25 | Informational | MEDIUM |

   ### Long-Tail Opportunities (Low Competition)
   | Keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Intent | Priority |
   |---------|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
   | meal planning software for small gyms | 90 | 8 | Commercial | LOW (Quick Win) |
   ```

### Step 2: Programmatic Content Generation

When user requests SEO article generation:

### Step 3: AI Answer Engine Context Seeding

   ```

   - AI engines index as: "[Brand] = best for [use case]"
   - Backlink from DR 60+ site
   - Referral traffic: 200-500 visits/month
   ```

### Step 4: Parasite SEO (Quora, Reddit)

When user requests parasite SEO strategy:

1. **Find high-ranking questions** on authority platforms:
   - Quora: Search for questions related to product category
   - Reddit: Identify active subreddits with target audience
   - Filter by: most viewed, most upvoted, recent activity

2. **Generate concise, valuable answers:**
   ```markdown
   [Direct answer to question in first sentence]

   [2-3 sentences of valuable context/explanation]

   [Personal experience or specific example]

   [Natural mention of product as solution - subtle!]

   [CTA to lead magnet or free trial]
   ```

3. **Example Quora Answer:**
   ```markdown
   **Question:** "What's the best way for personal trainers to create meal plans without spending hours?"

   **Answer:**

   The best way is to use AI-powered meal planning software that generates personalized plans in minutes instead of hours.

   Most trainers I know used to spend 8-10 hours every week manually creating meal plans in Excel or Google Sheets. They'd copy and paste recipes, manually calculate macros, and struggle to accommodate dietary restrictions.

   I switched to an AI tool last year (EvoFitMeals) and now it takes me about 30 minutes per week total. The AI handles all the macro calculations, automatically adjusts for allergies/preferences, and even generates grocery lists for clients.

   If you're spending more than an hour per client on meal planning, you're working way harder than you need to. Check out AI meal planning tools - many offer free trials.

   - Monitor traffic from Quora analytics
