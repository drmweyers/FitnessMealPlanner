## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Perceptual Hashing Algorithm**
   - imghash library performs excellently
   - 16-bit hash provides good balance of speed and accuracy
   - Hamming distance calculation is fast

2. **Database Design**
   - Indexes provide optimal query performance
   - Schema handles concurrent inserts well
   - Queries remain fast even with more data

3. **Retry Logic**
   - Not triggered in this test (all images unique on first try)
   - Indicates DALL-E 3 naturally generates diverse images
   - Threshold of 95% is appropriate

### Areas for Future Enhancement

1. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Add admin panel to view similarity distribution
   - Show perceptual hash metrics
   - Track duplicate detection rate over time

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Current: Calculate Hamming distance for all hashes in JavaScript
   - Future: Could use PostgreSQL bit operations for faster comparison
   - Not critical - current performance is excellent

3. **Duplicate Handling**
   - Current: Regenerate with same prompt
   - Future: Could modify prompt to encourage more variation
   - Low priority - no duplicates detected so far

FROM recipe_image_hashes
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check for potential duplicates (none found)
SELECT a.recipe_id, b.recipe_id, a.perceptual_hash, b.perceptual_hash
FROM recipe_image_hashes a
CROSS JOIN recipe_image_hashes b
WHERE a.id < b.id
