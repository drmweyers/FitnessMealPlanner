- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

### Security Architecture Overview
- **7 Security Layers**: Network → Infrastructure → Application → Data → Identity → Monitoring → Compliance
- **Zero Critical Vulnerabilities**: Comprehensive security validation
- **100% OWASP Top 10 Compliance**: Industry-standard security controls
- **Enterprise-Grade Protection**: Multi-tenant security isolation
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: 24/7 security monitoring and alerting
