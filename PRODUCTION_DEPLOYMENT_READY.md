## üìã Phase 2: Production Deployment - AWAITING EXECUTION

### When You're Ready to Deploy to Production

Follow these steps from `BMAD_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`:

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Verification (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Check production database exists
doctl databases list

# 2. Create database backup (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP)
# Via DigitalOcean Dashboard:
# Navigate to: Databases ‚Üí fitnessmealplanner ‚Üí Backups ‚Üí Create Backup

# 3. Verify current production status
curl -I https://evofitmeals.com
doctl apps get 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958
```

### Step 2: Database Migration (10 minutes)

**IMPORTANT: Run migration BEFORE deploying code**

**Method 1: Via DigitalOcean Console (RECOMMENDED)**
```
1. Navigate to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/databases
2. Select: fitnessmealplanner database
3. Click: "Console" tab
4. Copy SQL from: scripts/0019_create_recipe_image_hashes.sql
5. Paste and execute
6. Verify: \d recipe_image_hashes
```

**Method 2: Via doctl CLI**
```bash
# Get connection string
doctl databases connection-string <database-id> fitnessmealplanner

# Execute migration
psql "<connection-string>" < scripts/0019_create_recipe_image_hashes.sql

# Verify table exists
psql "<connection-string>" -c "\d recipe_image_hashes"
```

**Migration SQL:**
```sql
-- Located in: scripts/0019_create_recipe_image_hashes.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS recipe_image_hashes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    recipe_id UUID REFERENCES recipes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    perceptual_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    similarity_hash VARCHAR(255),
    image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    dalle_prompt TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- 3 indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_recipe_image_hashes_perceptual_hash ON recipe_image_hashes(perceptual_hash);
CREATE INDEX idx_recipe_image_hashes_recipe_id ON recipe_image_hashes(recipe_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_recipe_image_hashes_created_at ON recipe_image_hashes(created_at DESC);
```

### Step 3: Docker Build & Push (15-20 minutes)

**Option A: Docker Push via Registry (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
# 1. Build production image
docker build --target prod -t fitnessmealplanner:prod .

# 2. Tag for DigitalOcean registry
docker tag fitnessmealplanner:prod registry.digitalocean.com/bci/fitnessmealplanner:prod

# 3. Login to registry
doctl registry login

# 4. Push to registry
docker push registry.digitalocean.com/bci/fitnessmealplanner:prod

# 5. Auto-deployment triggers automatically (wait 4-7 seconds)
```

**Option B: Manual Deployment via Dashboard (if push fails)**
```
1. Navigate to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps
2. Select: fitnessmealplanner-prod
3. Click: "Deploy" button (top-right)
4. Select: "Force Rebuild and Deploy"
5. Confirm deployment
6. Monitor progress (3-5 minutes)
```

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment (5-10 minutes)

```bash
# Monitor deployment status
watch -n 5 'doctl apps get 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 | grep -E "Phase|Active"'

# Expected phases:
# 1. BUILDING (3-4 minutes)
# 2. DEPLOYING (1-2 minutes)
# 3. ACTIVE (success!)

# Check logs if needed
doctl apps logs 600abc04-b784-426c-8799-0c09f8b9a958 --tail 100
```

### Step 5: Post-Deployment Validation (15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Health check
curl https://evofitmeals.com/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}

# 2. Login test
curl -X POST https://evofitmeals.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@fitmeal.pro","password":"AdminPass123"}'
# Expected: 200 OK with token

# 3. Verify table in production database
psql "<production-connection-string>" -c "\d recipe_image_hashes"
# Expected: Table description with 3 indexes

# 4. CRITICAL TEST: Generate 1 recipe with image
# Via Admin Panel:
# 1. Login to https://evofitmeals.com/login (admin@fitmeal.pro)
# 2. Navigate to Admin ‚Üí BMAD Generator
# 3. Generate 1 recipe with image enabled
# 4. Wait for completion (~30 seconds)
# 5. Verify image appears and perceptual hash stored

# 5. Check perceptual hash was stored
psql "<production-connection-string>" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recipe_image_hashes WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';"
# Expected: 1

# 6. Verify hash format
psql "<production-connection-string>" -c "SELECT perceptual_hash FROM recipe_image_hashes ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;"
# Expected: 16-character hex string
```

## üîÑ Rollback Plan (If Needed)

**If deployment fails or issues occur:**

### Quick Rollback (<2 minutes)
```bash
# Via DigitalOcean Dashboard
# Navigate to: Apps ‚Üí fitnessmealplanner-prod ‚Üí Deployments
# Click: "Rollback to previous deployment" on commit de6acb0
```

### Database Rollback (if migration was applied)
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS recipe_image_hashes CASCADE;
```

### Code Rollback (if needed)
```bash
git revert a25e317
git push origin main
# Wait for auto-deploy
```
