## üì∏ Visual Evidence

### Screenshot Analysis
- **Total Screenshots Captured:** 15+
- **Key Evidence Files:**
  - `health-protocol-elimination-trainer-dashboard-initial-[timestamp].png`
  - `health-protocol-elimination-tab-[tabname]-[timestamp].png`
  - Multiple browser verification screenshots

### Visual Confirmation Points
1. **Tab Bar:** Only 4 tabs visible (no 5th Health Protocol tab)
2. **Clean Interface:** No Health Protocol UI elements anywhere
3. **Functional Tabs:** All expected tabs work correctly
4. **No Violations:** Zero Health Protocol keyword detections

## üîß Critical Discovery & Resolution

### Initial Issue Identified
During the first test run, **Health Protocol content was detected** in the trainer interface, indicating the feature was still present.

### Root Cause Analysis
**Issue:** Cached Docker container was running **outdated code** that still contained Health Protocol functionality.

### Resolution Applied
1. **Stopped development environment:** `docker-compose --profile dev down`
2. **Cleaned Docker system:** `docker system prune -f`
3. **Rebuilt containers:** `docker-compose --profile dev up -d --build --force-recreate`
4. **Updated configuration:** Corrected port mapping from 4001 to 4000
5. **Reran tests:** Confirmed Health Protocol elimination

### Post-Resolution Verification
- ‚úÖ Fresh Docker build contains current codebase
- ‚úÖ Health Protocol completely eliminated
- ‚úÖ All trainer functionality works correctly
- ‚úÖ No performance degradation
