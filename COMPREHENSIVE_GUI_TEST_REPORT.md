**Severity:** HIGH  
**Component:** Registration page role selection dropdown  
**Error:** `Element is not stable` - causing 30+ second timeouts  
**Impact:** Users cannot complete registration  
**Root Cause:** ShadCN Select component has rendering stability issues  
**Reproduction:**
```
1. Navigate to /register
2. Attempt to select role from dropdown

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Component:** Registration form fields  
**Error:** `Element is not an <input>, <textarea> or [contenteditable] element`  
**Impact:** Form testing and validation fails  
**Root Cause:** Hidden select elements being detected as form inputs  
**Reproduction:**
```
1. Navigate to registration page
2. Form field detection fails on hidden select elements
3. Test automation cannot interact with fields properly
```
**Fix Required:** Improve form field accessibility and proper element types

#### 3. Authentication Flow Timeout Issues
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Component:** Login process across all user roles  
**Error:** Login attempts timing out before completion  
**Impact:** Test automation failures, potential real-user login issues  
**Root Cause:** Network latency or authentication service delays  
**Reproduction:**
```
1. Attempt login with valid credentials
2. Process times out before navigation completes  
3. Tests fail despite valid authentication
```
**Fix Required:** Optimize authentication flow and increase timeout thresholds

### MEDIUM PRIORITY BUGS

#### 4. Modal Interaction Interruptions
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Component:** Recipe generation modal and other dialogs  
**Issue:** Modals can be interrupted by browser navigation  
**Impact:** Loss of user input data, inconsistent UI state  
**Fix Required:** Implement proper modal state management and navigation guards

#### 5. Responsive Design Layout Shifts
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Component:** Multiple viewports on mobile/tablet  
**Issue:** Layout shifts during viewport transitions  
**Impact:** Poor user experience on mobile devices  
**Fix Required:** Implement stable responsive layouts with CSS Grid/Flexbox

#### 6. Form Validation Message Inconsistency
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Component:** Various forms across the application  
**Issue:** Inconsistent error message display and styling
