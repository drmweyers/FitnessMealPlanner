## ‚ö° Performance Architecture

### Redis Caching Strategy

**Cache Patterns:**
- **User Favorites:** `HASH` structure with 1-hour TTL
- **Popular Recipes:** `SORTED SET` with 15-minute TTL
- **Trending Content:** `SORTED SET` with 5-minute TTL
- **Recommendations:** `LIST` structure with 2-hour TTL
- **Real-time Counters:** `HASH` with 1-minute TTL

**Cache Operations:**
- Pipeline operations for batch processing
- Automatic cache invalidation on data changes
- Memory optimization with LRU eviction
- Read replicas for scaling read-heavy workloads

### Database Indexes

**High-Performance Indexes:**
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Partial indexes for filtered queries
- Time-based indexes for analytics queries
- Covering indexes to avoid table lookups

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Fast user favorites lookup
CREATE INDEX recipe_favorites_user_recipe_idx ON recipe_favorites (user_id, recipe_id);

-- Trending recipes by timeframe
CREATE INDEX recipe_popularity_trending_score_idx ON recipe_popularity (trending_score);

-- User recommendation retrieval
CREATE INDEX recipe_recommendations_user_score_idx ON recipe_recommendations (user_id, recommendation_score);
```

### Scalability Patterns

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- Sharding by user_id for user-specific tables
- Read replicas for analytics queries
- Connection pooling with automatic failover

**Query Optimization:**
- Prepared statements for common queries
- Batch operations for bulk inserts/updates
- Materialized views for complex aggregations
